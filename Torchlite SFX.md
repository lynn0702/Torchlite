***Woodguide:*** When you sleep on untilled ground with no roof over your head for at least an hour, spend a Ⓟ to step down **Exhausted**.  

***Work Ethic:*** When you take your time to do things right on a roll to create an asset, if you roll one or more hitches, you can take **Exhausted** **d6** to reroll one or two dice that rolled hitches.  

***Working On It (Limit):*** Earn a Ⓟ by revealing that you can’t complete an urgent task because you are missing something crucial that’s difficult to obtain or because you need much more time than is currently feasible. Then take **Demoralized** or **Enthralled** stress.
