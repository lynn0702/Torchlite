## What Is TorchLite?  
  
*It started when they raided your village. You and your friends tracked down the raiders to their hideout, dealt with them, and found they were taking orders from somewhere else. You investigated, which took you through a lot of ruins and city sewers and cobwebbed wizard towers to figure things out. Now you’re on horseback beside the king of the realm, contemplating how to crack the fortress of the lich who’s been pulling all the strings, and maybe tonight is the end of it all or maybe it just keeps going after this.*  

*It all depends if Jerry can still make Thursday nights work with his schedule.*  
  
This is *TorchLite*, a pulp-fantasy tabletop roleplaying game of action, intrigue, and exploration built on the *Cortex Lite* rules framework. These simple and extensible game mechanics will take you through epic landscapes, thrilling action sequences, and startling-yet-satisfying plot twists. All you need to provide is a little imagination, which we trust you’ve got in spades.  
  
The game is made up of two big pieces: colorful fantasy adventurers, and the dangerous challenges and locations they encounter.  

Not coincidentally, the main sections of these game books are [Fantastic Adventurers](#fantastic-adventurers) and [A World of Dangerous Challenges](#a-world-of-dangerous-challenges). Each one details key pieces of *TorchLite* and you can start anywhere you like.  
  
If you want to build a character, well, [Fantastic Adventurers](#fantastic-adventurers) is your ticket.  
  
Or if you kind of already know that you’re going to be running the game, come take a peek at [A World of Dangerous Challenges](#a-world-of-dangerous-challenges); we’ve got you covered.  

Whatever you do, have fun—and always check for traps.  
  
*TorchLite* evolved from *Cortex Lite*, a simple roleplaying game compatible with the Cortex Prime roleplaying game. *Cortex Lite* is available for free on [itch.io](http://lite.xine.ink).  
  
### Your World  
  
In a tabletop roleplaying game like this one, each player takes on the role of one or more characters. *TorchLite* characters adventure through a fantasy realm chosen or created by you and your group, and the players use the rules to determine the results of their characters’ actions. This game makes certain genre-based assumptions about how your world will work, so those assumptions are explained here, so that you can build on or change them—or set them aside—to fit the kind of adventures the players wish to have.  
  
#### Medieval Fantasy  
  
Much of the world’s culture and technology is roughly equivalent to that of the medieval or Renaissance period in lands surrounding the Mediterranean—Southern Europe, West Asia, and North Africa. Societies are dominated by monarchs, warlords, and aristocrats hungry for dynastic prestige. Wars are won with fortified castles, archery, and armored soldiers on horseback.  

Yet these real-world inspirations are mixed with fantastical elements like magical spells and mythical creatures. Peoples such as elves, dwarves, ogres, and goblins have separate cultures and history. Dragons hoard gold in hidden lairs, herds of pegasi graze treetops, and undead walk by night.  
  
#### Post-Apocalyptic Peril  
  
This world has seen great empires with monumental architecture and well-guarded trade routes—but they’re gone now. Civilization exists only in isolated settlements separated by dangerous swathes of wilderness. Travel in any direction means crossing a vast expanse of dangers, abandoning safety to face roving bands of marauders and unpredictable monsters. The few existing maps of areas more than a few miles from population centers are likely sketchy or inaccurate.  

This fallen land conceals great opportunities. Without unifying empires or superheroic champions, the player characters take center-stage, making decisions of great consequence that change the world around them. Furthermore, the collapse of past ruling powers has left behind remote ruins, misremembered relics, and unrecovered riches. Few adventurers return from expeditions to trap-filled dungeons or crumbling, spider-haunted temples, but those who do often bring back priceless treasures.  
  
#### Magical Spells & Enchanted Relics  
  
Magic is a fundamental part of the world. It can be used to fuel the casting of spells by a variety of means: focused will, metaphysical knowledge, inborn talent, attunement to primal nature spirits, pacts with eldritch entities, psychic abilities, empowering items, etc.  

Long ago, artificers learned to infuse sorcery into objects, an art forgotten by all but a few. These magic items are more precious than gold or jewels. Finding such wonders is often the main motivation for adventurers delving into ancient ruins.  

Places may be enchanted as well, creating magically warded towers, beguiling forests, hallowed temples, and the like. As societies rise and fall, spellcasters have used defensive abjurations and deadly traps to protect important treasures and locations. It takes great skill to circumvent these measures, which is a major reason why adventurers often have shortened lifespans.  
  
#### Tangible Divinity & Scant Medicine  
  
Religious faith is far more than just a social phenomenon. This game doesn’t tell you what belief systems are prominent in your world, but it does assume that the Divine actively intervenes in mortal life to some degree. The influence of higher powers is an observable fact. Devotion to deity allows clerics, some paladins, and others to manifest divine spells and other miracles. This holiness—channeled through the laying of hands—is the most powerful and reliable form of healing in a time when medicine is relatively primitive.  
  
#### The Great Unknown  
  
Due to the current dark age following the decline of civilization, not to mention the vast strangeness of the cosmos, the world is little understood. No scholar can tell you the full history of the world or the nature of all the planes beyond. Even geography is shrouded in mystery, since communication and travel between settlements are so limited. One small region might hide many dangers, with so many cultures having risen and fallen and left their remnants behind.  

This status quo makes the GM’s task simpler. There doesn’t need to be a map of the continent, a timeline of ancient history, or a defined cosmology. The GM just has to have a handle on where the PCs have been and where they’re likely to go next session. They can make other decisions about the setting—world-building can be loads of fun on its own—but thinking one session at a time is all the game requires.  
  
#### Cosmic Forces  
  
The world is pressured and shaped by opposing cosmic forces, including Chaos, Order, Good, and Evil. For the average person the tumult and conflicts between these powers are like the weather, interactions that can affect their lives but which are beyond their ken.  

Certain folk are aligned with these forces (and certain creatures, such as angels or demons, even embody them), but these are a minority. Most people are unaligned, and even aligned mortals retain free will. Aligning with Order doesn’t mean someone obeys or agrees with every law, and while the fey are beings of Chaos, they are also strictly bound by ancient pacts and customs. A champion may wear the mantle of Good, but actually being a good person is much more complicated. Few willingly align with Evil, but those labeled as “evil” by a society may be the ones living the principles that moral authorities espouse.  
  
#### Other Planes of Existence  
  
There are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in mundane philosophy—and Heaven and Earth are far from the only worlds. Beyond the frontiers of everyday reality, there are elemental planes where everything is fire or ice, astral and ethereal planes where the spiritual is substantial and the physical is ghostly, wild fey realms, various temporary afterlives, an impossibly huge World Tree with branches that connect every plane, a river running through the underworlds, and more.  

Each of these other planes seems to be dominated by one theme, whether it is an element like Ice or Fire, a phenomenon such as Life or Death, or the cosmic forces of Good, Evil, Chaos, or Order. The energies of these otherworlds leak into each other, and into the mortal world, allowing them to be drawn upon for magical effects. In some places, different planes touch or cross over. Sages view the mortal world as a nexus of intersection between these extremes.  

Most inhabitants of other planes are aloof, uninterested in affairs beyond their native dimension. However, certain otherworldly beings seek interaction or service from mortals. They sponsor cults and other secret factions, make pacts channeling the energies of their home planes for warlocks to use in spells, and seek pawns for intrigue and conflicts with other entities.  
  
### How to Play *TorchLite*  
  
This section remixes the player-facing rules from *Cortex Lite*. You can grab that complete game for free on [itch.io](http://lite.xine.ink). If you want to jump to the fancy new *TorchLite* stuff, that’s in [Fantastic Adventurers](#fantastic-adventurers).  
  
#### PCs & GM  
  
As in many tabletop role-playing games, one player takes on the role of the Game Moderator, or GM, rather than playing their own character. The GM frames scenes, portrays supporting characters (called GMCs, or Game Moderator Characters), controls the opposition (including rolling dice), and ends scenes.  

The characters portrayed by everybody else are called player characters, or PCs.  
  
#### Rolling Dice  
  
During play, everybody contributes to the story, but at some point you break out dice, introducing just enough randomness so no one knows what will happen until events unfold during play.  
  
##### Traits & Dice  
  
Each character has a number of traits, which are things—abilities, skills, useful items—that can help them accomplish their goals.  

Each trait is rated with one of five die sizes, each represented in this text with a symbol: a 4-sided die or d4, a six-sided die or d6, an 8-sided die or d8, a 10-sided die or d10, or a 12-sided die or d12. Each trait in a set is rated with a die size: d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12. Generally, larger die sizes make a trait more effective, so d6 is better than d4.  
  
##### Trait Sets  
  
Traits are organized into trait sets.  

Examples of trait sets used in *TorchLite* are attributes (**Agility**, **Alertness**, **Brains**, **Brawn**, **Charisma**, and **Composure**), roles (**Scholar**, **Scoundrel**, **Scout**, **Soldier**, and **Speaker**), and signature assets (items or other factors that provide an advantage, such as **Hidden Knife** or **Magnifying Glass**). One example trait set for a character might be the attributes **Agility** d6, **Alertness** d6, **Brains** d6, **Brawn** d10, **Charisma** d8, and **Composure** d8.  

When you want your character to do something, if there’s nothing getting in your way, you just do it. If there is opposition (such as an opponent, a difficult environment, or a time limit), you roll the dice for certain traits to figure out if you succeed or fail.  
  
##### Your Dice Pool  
  
When you roll, you pick the most relevant trait from each set and roll the die for each of those traits, all together in one pool of dice. (An example dice pool might be **Brawn** d10, **Cunning Rebel** d8, **Scoundrel** d8 and **Hidden Knife** d6)  
  
##### Your Total  
  
After rolling, you add two of the die results together for your total. The total is often, but not always, the two highest results.  

So if my highest rolls were a 6 on a d10 and a 5 on a d6, I'd probably want to add those two together for a total of 11.  
  
##### Your Effect Die  
  
After choosing die results for your total, you pick one of the other dice you rolled to be your effect die. This choice doesn’t affect whether you succeed or fail. It’s kind of like how a die for damage in the most popular fantasy RPGs is separate from your attack roll to hit.  

If I rolled d6 d8 d8 d10 for my dice pool, and used the results I rolled on the d6 and the d10 for my total, I’d use one of the remaining d8s as my effect die.  
  
##### Opposition  
  
When you roll, another player (often the Game Moderator, or GM) builds their own dice pool and rolls it. You compare your roll’s total to theirs, and the higher roll succeeds.  

If I roll and get a total of 11 and the opposition gets a 9, I win.  

The player who rolls first sets the bar for how difficult the roll should be, so that player wins ties.  
  
##### Success  
  
If you win, the size of your effect die (not the number it rolled) determines how big of an effect your success had. You might say, “My effect die is d8.”  

For example, if you roll to hit someone with a weapon, your total determines whether you hit (like comparing an attack roll to armor class in the world’s most popular RPG), and your effect die would be how much damage you inflict. Your total tells you whether the story goes your way; your effect die tells you how far it goes.  
  
##### An Example of Play  
  
Perhaps your cunning rebel character wants to reach a door, but an enemy knight stands in her way. You describe the rebel trying to fake the knight out, feinting a retreat before lashing out with the knife she has stashed up her sleeve.  

The GM asks you to roll dice to see if she succeeds. You roll her **Brawn** d10, **Scoundrel** d8, **Cunning Rebel** d8, and **Hidden Knife** d6, getting 6 on the d10, 2s on the d8s, and 5 on the d6.  

You pick the 6 and 5 to add together, making your total 11. You use a leftover d8 as your effect die.  

The knight’s total against her is 8, and since 11 is higher than 8, your rebel wins. She gets to inflict her d8 effect die on the knight. Her thin blade slides through a joint in her foe’s armor, stabbing deep into his flank.  
  
#### The Shape of a *TorchLite* Game  
  
If that explanation all made sense, then you know how to play *TorchLite*. Everything else in the system fits into, bolts onto, or adds a twist to this single mechanic. The rest of this section breaks down other rules that build on those fundamentals.  
  
##### Session Zero and Safety Tools  
  
Playing a tabletop RPG can become a bad experience if everyone involved isn’t on the same page about the topics and themes they’ll be exploring in play. The best way to align those expectations is usually having a formal process, making sure everyone has a chance to be heard and set appropriate boundaries. That process can be a part of a “Session Zero”, a conversation before actual play begins that can also provide a chance to make characters together, discuss the game, build anticipation, and decide what content should or shouldn’t be a part of the game.  
  
You should also use appropriate safety tools, such as Lines and Veils, the *X-Card* by John Stavropoulos or *Script Change* by Beau Jágr Sheldon.  
  
Script Change is especially recommended, because the framework it provides can improve the experience of playing a tabletop RPG even when content concerns aren't an issue. What’s important is choosing the tools that work for you and your group.  
  
##### Sessions, Scenes, & Beats  
  
Games are played in sessions. A session is however long your group gathers to play at a time, whether in person or online.  
  
Sessions are divided into segments called scenes, just like a play, film, or TV show.  
  
Player actions take place in units of time called beats. A beat is simply how long it takes to complete one action or one piece of a larger action (including both the die roll to do something and the roll opposing it).  
  
##### Tests  
  
The most basic kind of die roll is a test. You say you want to do something, and if it requires a roll, but that roll isn’t directly opposed by another significant character (or PC), the GM just grabs some dice and rolls. Usually the GM sets a difficulty, choosing two dice depending on how hard they think the roll should be: d4 d4, d6 d6, d8 d8, d10 d10, or d12 d12. d4 d4 is very easy; d12 d12 is very hard.  
  
For a test, the GM rolls first, their total sets the difficulty, and then you roll. If your total is higher than the difficulty total, you succeed; if it is equal or lower, you fail.  
  
##### Action Order  
  
Normally, a player can just roll a test or describe their character’s actions whenever it makes sense, as part of the game’s ongoing conversation. When it’s helpful to organize things a bit more, the GM can move things into action order.  

When the game is in action order, the scene splits into rounds. A round is nothing more or less than the amount of time it takes for every participant in a scene to take one beat’s worth of action (often called a turn).  
  
Usually, the GM chooses one player to go first. After a player takes a beat, they choose who goes next. The GM and any GMCs active in the scene get to take their own beats as well. Once everyone has taken a beat to do what they want to do, the round ends.  

Whoever goes last in a round chooses who goes first in the next round, and players can choose themselves!  
  
#### Plot Points  
  
This game uses a special currency called plot points (abbreviated Ⓟ), which you can spend to affect the story. You’ll likely earn and spend plot points all the time. Every player gets at least one Ⓟ at the start of each session.  
  
The most important uses of plot points include:  
  
You can spend a Ⓟ to instantly create a d6 asset.  
  
When you add up die results for your total, you can spend one Ⓟ to add in the result from one additional die, increasing your total.  
  
You can spend a Ⓟ to make an asset useful to a whole group of people instead of just one.  
  
When an asset would go away at the end of a scene or session, you can spend a Ⓟ to keep it, starting the next scene or session with the asset still in play.  
  
Unless specified otherwise, you can spend plot points at any time, even when it isn’t your beat or turn.  
  
Any unspent plot points are lost at the end of a session, so it’s best not to hoard them.  
  
##### Hitches  
  
When you roll 1 on a die, you can’t count that die towards your total or use it for your effect die.  
  
A die that rolls a 1 is called a hitch. When you roll a hitch, the GM can grant you a plot point to give you a d6 complication (which may step up a complication you already have).  
  
When the GM rolls a hitch, it’s called an opportunity. When the GM rolls an opportunity, you can spend a Ⓟ to step up an existing asset or step down a complication.  
  
##### Extra Effects  
  
When you want to achieve multiple outcomes from a single roll (including affecting more than one target), you can do so by spending plot points to keep extra effect dice beyond the first.  
  
For each Ⓟ spent, you can choose one extra die from your roll to become an effect die. You can’t choose hitches or dice that are already effect dice or part of your total. If you run out of dice to choose from, you can’t keep more effect dice.  
  
Each effect die must do a different thing. For example, if you are fighting a pair of thugs on a swinging platform over a chasm, you can use two effect dice to assign an Unbalanced complication to each thug, or to assign both Unbalanced and a Frightened complication to the same thug, but you can’t use extra effect dice to assign Unbalanced to the same thug more than once with the same roll.  
  
Also, if you assign effect dice to multiple targets that each have their own dice to roll, each target gets their own opposition roll against you. Only those you beat take the effect.  
  
When you step up a d12 effect die, you gain an extra d6 effect die for that roll.  
  
#### Effect Dice  
  
When you succeed on a roll, your effect die usually becomes an asset (a new temporary trait that benefits someone) or a complication (a new temporary trait that makes things harder for someone).  

When an asset or complication is created, it gains a name to go with its die rating, such as **Blinded** d10, **Blackmailed** d12, **Bound Wrists** d6, **Cunning Plan** d6, **Hiding in Shadows** d6, **Inspired** d10, **Shield Spell** d8, or **Stolen Horse** d8. The player who creates an asset or complication gets to name and describe it.  

Assets and complications aren’t added to every roll; like other traits, they only apply when it makes sense in the story for the particular action described. The default assumption is that assets and complications go away when a scene ends.  

Most rolls create some kind of complication or asset, but there are a couple other things you can do.  

You might simply roll to change your situation, such as by opening a locked door. In this case, your effect die just measures your degree of success: a d4 might be getting the door open just a crack, while a d12 busts it wide open.  

You might also roll to step down or end a complication; this is called recovery, and the rules for it are explained later.  
  
##### Heroic Success  
  
When you succeed on a roll, if your total beats the opposing roll by 5 or more, you’ve scored a heroic success. This means that you not only achieve what you set out to do, but surpass your own expectations in doing so. For every 5 by which you beat the opposing roll, your effect die steps up by one size.  

##### Comparing Effect Dice  

Even when you fail a roll against someone, your effect die still matters. If your roll fails, but your effect die is larger than the opposition’s effect die, the opposition’s effect die steps down.  

##### There’s Always an Effect  

Every roll always has a minimum of one d4 effect die. If stepping down dice, removing dice due to hitches, or any other situation would prevent a roll from having an effect die, give that roll one d4 effect die before resolving it.  
  
#### Complications  
  
A complication is a temporary trait that makes things harder for you, so you don’t roll it yourself. Instead, your opposition can roll it against you, and if someone else has a complication, you can add it to your dice pool when rolling against them.  

Here’s a sample list of complications that you might inflict (or suffer) during play: **Cursed with Sores**, **Distracted**, **Entangled by Vines**, **Indebted to Donna Ricci**, **Notoriety**, **On Fire**, **Outflanked**, **Out of Arrows**, **Out of Mana**, **Poisoned**.  

##### No d4 Complications  

Unlike other traits that run from d4 to d12, d4 complications do not exist in *TorchLite*. When you take a new complication, if it would be d4 or smaller, it becomes a d6. When an existing complication would step down to less than d6, it just goes away.  

##### Taken Out  

If a complication on any character would step up to a die size larger than d12, the complication stays at d12, but that character is taken out.  

When you are taken out, you are unable to influence the story—one way or another, you’ve been overwhelmed and can no longer participate. When someone gets knocked out by a brigand, falls through a trap door into a prison cell, or is transformed into a statue, they’ve been taken out. Being taken out usually only lasts until the end of the scene.  

##### Stepping Up Complications  

An important rule of complications is that an existing one can be stepped up by further actions that inflict the same complication. So, if you already have a **Tangled Up** d6 complication, and someone throws a lasso around your arms and torso, that complication could step up to **Tangled Up** d8. Each time another roll worsens your complication, its effect die steps it up. If the effect die is larger than the complication’s rating, the complication steps up to that effect die’s size.  

When naming a complication, it is best to use a name that leaves room for things to get worse—it might get stepped up, after all. Instead of naming a complication **Knocked Out**, it makes more sense to call it **On the Ropes** or **Woozy** or **Concussed**. So if a spell that would turn a character to stone inflicts a complication rather than taking the character out, the complication might just be called **Turning to Stone**, as the character’s body slowly petrifies and their limbs become heavy and slow.  

Complications can also be renamed when circumstances change. If a character already trapped in a net is then pushed into quicksand, their complication might go from **Tangled Up** d8 to **Restrained** d10, changing the name to include all the problems limiting their ability to move and escape.  

##### Stress  

The most common forms of complications are called stress. These are the kinds of consequences that befall characters all the time. While they work just like complications in all other respects, they have their own rules for when they go away.  

Four kinds of stress are used in *TorchLite*: **Damaged** stress, **Demoralized** stress, **Enthralled** stress, and **Exhausted** stress. Each type of stress represents a different kind of situation, as follows:  

**Damaged** is physical, bodily harm, like getting punched in the eye, cut by a blade, poisoned by an assassin, burned by flame, etc.  

**Demoralized** stress represents becoming frightened, insecure, discouraged, disillusioned, worried, pessimistic, or any other mental state that makes you feel like you might be better off quitting.  

**Enthralled** stress is when you are fascinated, tempted, distracted, hyper-focused, charmed, smitten, emotionally overwhelmed, or just caught up in your own thoughts.  

**Exhausted** stress is fatigue, burnout, tiredness, exertion, lack of energy, or simply an unmet need for rest.  

##### Failure & Stress  

When you fail a test, you take d6 stress. The opposition chooses the type of stress. Perhaps a character feels **Demoralized** by their lack of success, **Exhausted** by the wasted effort, or **Enthralled** by an interesting problem they can’t seem to solve yet. Generally, if a character tries and fails to cast a spell, the stress they take is **Exhausted**, representing the drain on their personal magical energies.  

##### Stress vs. Complications  

When something happens that makes things harder for a character, but it isn’t covered by one of the stress types, represent it with a free-form complication instead, such as **Grappled**, **Prone**, **Enraged**, **Nauseous**, **Deafened**, **Tangled in a Giant Spider-Web**, **Turning Into a Frog**, etc.  
  
#### Assets  
  
An asset is a temporary trait that grants an advantage. When you create an asset, you choose whether it is for you or for another character. Usually, only the character you choose can use it.  

Sometimes, an asset becomes permanent, making it an ongoing advantage that a character uses all the time. Such assets are called signature assets.  

##### Multiple Assets  

A default rule for assets is that, unlike other types of traits, more than one asset can be added to the same dice pool, as long as each asset is being applied to the activity for which the player is rolling.  

Assets are possibly the most basic trait in the game, but there are a lot of ways this versatile trait can feature in your fantasy game.  

##### Creating Assets  

You can create an asset with a test. Your effect die becomes the rating of the asset, which you may use for the rest of the scene. Here’s some assets that you might create during play: **Cloaked by Shadow**, **Conjured Fireballs**, **Fame and Glory**, **Fat Purse of Doubloons**, **Grove Spirit’s Blessing**, **Intimidating Demeanor**, **Recon**, **Under Cover**.  

##### Shutting Down Assets  

Whether it is disarming the dread lord’s cursed sword, quashing the bloodlust of an angry mob, or revealing a hidden sneaking rogue, you may want to remove the assets of characters giving you trouble. To do so, you roll against that character, and they get to include the asset in their dice pool opposing you.  

On a success, you either:  

▶ shut down the asset if your effect die is larger than the asset  
▶ or step down the asset if your effect die is equal or lower  

When you step down an asset in this way or make it unavailable, it remains so until the end of the scene. Any player may do this by inflicting a complication larger than the asset’s rating. You can do it all in one go, or by starting a low-level complication like **Loosened Grip** and stepping it up with later rolls. When you step down an asset in this way or make it unavailable, it remains stepped down or shut down until the end of the scene. If the asset would’ve gone away at the end of the scene, that happens normally.  
  
#### Recovery  
  
Complications and stress can be downright crippling. Getting rid of complications or stress is called recovery.  

##### Downtime  

During a scene when characters have a chance to recover—by resting or some other form of self-care—all stress dice step down.  

##### Expiring Complications  

Complications go away at the end of a scene or when they are no longer narratively appropriate.  

##### Seizing an Opportunity  

When the GM rolls an opportunity, you can spend a Ⓟ to step down a complication or stress.  

##### Recovery Rolls  

Other characters can try to help you recover. (Generally, you can’t recover your own stress unless you have an SFX that allows it.)  

To do so, the helping character rolls a test against a difficulty of d8 d8 plus the complication or stress die that they are trying to help you with.  

**On a success**, they either step down your complication or stress (if their effect die is equal or smaller to its die) or remove the complication or stress entirely (if their effect die is larger).  

**On most failures**, nothing happens.  

**If they fail with one or more hitches**, your complication or stress steps up and the GM gives both of you a Ⓟ.  

##### Fresh Start  

At the start of a new session, all complications and stresses are removed—unless the last session ended in a cliffhanger and the new session picks up right where you left off. (If that’s the case, players keep their Ⓟ as well.)  
  
#### SFX & Dice Tricks  
  
Your character gains SFX, special effects that give you added influence over the story. These reflect your character’s extraordinary abilities or their powerful role in the narrative. Many SFX require you to spend plot points to activate them. Other SFX allow you to impose a disadvantage on your character in order to earn Ⓟ or another reward. For example, the ***Hinder*** SFX lets you earn a Ⓟ by rolling a smaller die.  

Using an SFX is always a choice; you are never compelled to activate your character’s SFX, unless that SFX is a Limit. A Limit is an SFX which can be activated by the GM.  

Some SFX allow you to add your own complication to your dice pool. A complication included in a roll can’t also be included in the opposing dice pool, so using such an SFX also prevents the other side from using that complication against you.  

##### Doubling Dice  

Sometimes, the rules tell you to double a die in your pool. When you double a die, you add another die of the same size to the pool before you roll.  

##### One Roll  

Unless the text of the SFX itself or another rule says otherwise, when you step up, step down, or double a trait using an SFX, you only do so for a single roll.  

##### Reroll  

Some SFX allow a reroll of some or all of the dice in your pool after you first roll them. You can’t use SFX to reroll the same die roll more than once, though other players might use SFX to reroll it.  

Usually, SFX of this type specify how many dice are rerolled. If an SFX says to reroll all the dice, or if it doesn’t specify, reroll every die rolled as part of that dice pool.  

##### Stepping Up & Stepping Down  

The rules sometimes tell you to step up a die, changing it from a die of one size to one of the next larger size, (such as changing d4 to d6 or d8 to d10) or to step down a die (the reverse, such as d12 to d10).  

When you step up a d12 in your dice pool, you keep the d12, but add an extra d6 to your pool as well.  

When you step down a d4 in your pool, you remove that die entirely.  

##### Stepping Down Assets  

When an SFX allows you step down an asset for some benefit, that asset remains so indefinitely unless the SFX says otherwise. It can still be stepped up by normal means (such as activating an opportunity). If an asset is stepped down below d4, it is eliminated. Signature assets are restored to their full value at the end of the scene.  

##### Stepping Down Stress or Complications  

When an SFX lets you step down a stress or complication, it remains stepped down indefinitely, as if with a successful recovery roll, unless the SFX says otherwise. (So if an SFX lets you step down someone’s **Damaged**, for example, you have applied healing to their injury.)  

##### Using Your Own Complications  

Some SFX let you add your own complication or stress to your dice pool for a roll. When you do so, the opposition doesn’t get to roll that complication or stress against you—you’re already using it to your own advantage, so in that moment it isn’t a disadvantage for you.  
  
#### Conditions  
  
A great deal of fantasy gaming’s nitty-gritty consists of conditions: getting turned into a frog, using a magic ring to turn invisible, being disarmed by an rival swordmaster, running out of the magical energy that fuels your spells, gaining increased confidence from an inspiring speech, and the like. In *TorchLite*, these kinds of conditions are modeled with assets, complications, and stress.  
  
##### Spellcasting Conditions  
  
As a default, hitches on rolls to use magic almost always inflict **Exhausted** stress on the caster. Some practitioners talk about an inner well of “mana,” “quintessence,” or “vim” that powers their spellcraft. **Exhausted** stress describes that internal resource dwindling.  

Hitches might occasionally result in other conditions, as the GM determines. Flinging hitched fireballs might singe your own fingertips, for instance, and inflict **Damaged** instead.  

Botches can inflict big **Exhausted** stress, but they can also be opportunities for mistargeted, uncontrolled spell conditions going terribly awry.  

Other complications can interfere with flinging magic. A spellcaster who is Silenced, Gagged, has her gesturing fingers Bound, or suffers a similar impairment has those complications rolled against her in tests to enact magic. She might also ***Hinder*** a distinction to recognize the limitations of her training—and pick up a sweet Ⓟ for her trouble.  
  
##### Tactical Conditions  
  
A simple test can inflict complications such as **Surrounded**, **Outflanked**, or **Exposed**, or create assets like **Under Cover**, **In Position**, or **Got the Drop On You**. If an asset applies to multiple characters, spend a Ⓟ to let everybody in the group use it.  

A feint can inflict a complication to the tune of **Distracted** or **Unbalanced**, which can then be leveraged in a later roll to inflict more lasting **Damaged**.  

Disarming an opponent can also work as a complication. If the item is represented by an asset die, inflicting a complication of a higher die size makes the asset inaccessible until the complication is recovered.  
  
##### Morale Conditions  
  
Intimidation both on and off the battlefield is neatly handled by inflicting **Demoralized** stress. That stress, in turn, can be rolled into other actions seeking to inflict **Damaged** or other conditions. It can even be added to dice pools to scare opponents into quitting the battlefield altogether.  

The trade off is that, in most situations, **Demoralized** stress is likely easier to recover than “more serious” conditions like **Damaged**, which might require skilled help or specialized tools. Any character can offer encouragement to any other character as an action intended to recover **Demoralized** stress. Characters can even attempt to psych themselves up and recover their own **Demoralized** stress.  
  
##### Magical Conditions  
  
A whole raft of magical conditions can simply be flashy ways of inflicting basic stress. A fascination charm inflicts **Enthralled**. A necromantic curse stripping away your life force inflicts **Exhausted**. And of course fireballs inflict **Damaged**.  

Sometimes you might want something a little more tailored to your circumstances, in which complications come into play. On Fire is a perennial favorite. **Blinded**, **Poisoned**, **Rooted**, or even **Chilled** work great, as well. Cursing a man to have a donkey’s head, if we want to get all Shakespearean, can also just be expressed as a complication.  

Casters may also spend a Ⓟ to keep an extra effect die. This way you can inflict a standard stress like **Damaged** as well as a flashy complication like **On Fire**.  

Some magical conditions, such as turning someone into a pig, can get tricky. Here the intent is not to complicate their later actions, but to remove the character from the scene entirely. Such a complication may need to be rephrased as an active but unfinished process, like **Slowly Becoming a Pig**.  
  
##### Stealth Conditions  
  
Characters sneaking past guards or into rooms without being noticed is usually resolved with a simple test. However if the player intends to leverage that “stealthed” status in later actions, they might spend a Ⓟ to gain the asset **Stealthed** or **In the Shadows**.  

Alternately, a character might take action to distract sentries or other opponents. Their intent may be to strike while distracted or shepherd less-stealthy characters past. Such a distraction can also be handled with a test, this time inflicting **Enthralled** stress, to represent the target’s attention being focused elsewhere, or a temporary complication representing a specific distraction, such as **Burning Tapestry** d8. Both the surprise attack and other characters’ stealth attempts may then add the complication into their die pool.  

Both assets and complications are eliminated whenever they are no longer relevant. When a **Stealthed** character reveals themself, the asset goes away. When the sentries are no longer distracted, the complication goes away.  

The classic Rogue tactic of striking from the shadows can combine both a **Stealthed** asset and a distracting complication, which is one of the reasons this tactic is so popular and effective.  
  
##### Wealth Conditions  
  
Treasure, loot, and shopping in town are hallmarks of fantasy roleplaying. The GM can freely offer characters an asset to represent treasure in an adventure: **Fat Sack of Doubloons** d6, **Stack of Credit Marks** d8, **Giant Ruby** d10. Alternately, players may “search for loot” and create an asset to represent what they find.  

Shopping is as simple as creating an asset with a test. Treasure assets can be added to these rolls, and on a success might be renamed (**Half-full Sack of Doubloons**), stepped down, or eliminated, depending on circumstance.  

Like any other temporary asset, treasure assets only last for one session, which emulates how wealth works in most fantasy stories. Characters like Conan the Cimmerian or Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser would come into a small fortune, only to have spent it by the start of their next adventure. A windfall is likely to be used immediately for something relevant to the plot.  

If a treasure is stored away or saved up, it doesn’t disappear, but either it’s no longer relevant to the immediate story and therefore is no longer worth a die, or the character should spend the 5 XP required to gain it as a signature asset, representing more permanent wealth or an interesting item they intend to carry with them on their adventures.  
  
### How to Be a Great Player  
  
As a *TorchLite* player, part of your job is to respond to the challenges the GM lays down as well as interact with fellow player characters. The game works best when you go hard: describe your actions with cinematic energy. Instead of “I hit the ork with my sword,” you can leap into battle, feint and riposte, taunt with cutting repartée, entangle the ork’s axe, or any number of other options. There’s no increased risk to your character when you get creative, so let your imagination run wild.
  
One enthusiastically descriptive player is entertaining, but the good stuff is when the whole table starts riffing off each other’s antics. Keep an eye out for opportunities to interact and open yourself up to others piling on to your fun. Be vocal: say “I need to shake this **Demoralized** stress!” or “I’m gonna pin them in place with a complication, so you can finish them off!” The game works better—both tactically and narratively—if everybody is a part of everybody else’s stories.  

There’s literally no limit on what any of you can describe except the nature of the story itself, which means the tone and mood of the game is entirely in your hands. This is a collaborative effort; it’s not the sole responsibility of any one player to decide what is or is not too silly, or too dark, or too outlandish. Talk about the kind of action, drama, and comedy you want to see in the game. If things start drifting in a direction that’s not fun for you, speak up so you can all stay on the same page.  
  
## Fantastic Adventurers  
  
You can’t have an exciting adventure without some brave (or foolhardy) adventurers to go get themselves into trouble and then back out again. Here’s how to make player characters for your *TorchLite* adventures.  
  
### Character Creation  
  
The default method of creating a character centers around the character’s three starting distinctions. The character’s people, profession, and persona give you a rough shape to start with.  

Each distinction choice suggests typical trait spreads, traits, and milestones, but these are entirely optional. You can distribute your die ratings however you like, create whichever traits feel appropriate to your character, and start with whichever milestone takes your fancy. The distinction lists simply provide an easy place to start.  

To create a character, you populate five trait sets—distinctions, attributes, roles, specialties, and signature assets—and assign a die rating to each trait in those sets.  

Your distinctions are chosen from three lists: one for your people, one for your profession, and one for your persona.  

For traits like attributes and roles, when making a new adventurer, you are given an array of die ratings for each set—such as d10, d8, d8, d8, d6, d6—and you assign one of these ratings to each trait in the set. So a character’s attributes might be **Agility** d8, **Alertness** d6, **Brains** d8, **Brawn** d6, **Charisma** d10, and **Composure** d6.  

For specialties and signature assets, you may select traits from the lists on your chosen profession and people spreads, or make up your own.  

When distributing your own trait ratings, it is usually easiest to choose which of the traits is most significant, the one the character will rely on most and for which they would likely be most well-known to others. Assign the largest die rating to that one. Then choose their second best trait, one they are still really great with and can rely on, even if it isn’t the most important one, and assign the second largest die rating to it. Then keep assigning in order from best to worst.  
  
#### Distinctions  
  
Much of your character is defined by three distinctions, words or brief phrases describing core aspects of their identity. Each distinction is rated d8. While attributes and roles describe what your character is good at, distinctions summarize who your character is. Your character begins with three distinctions: one representing their people, one for their profession, and one summing up their persona.  

Together, your three distinctions should sum up your overall character concept. If your character were the protagonist of a book, movie, or video game, and you were describing them to a friend, your distinctions would feature prominently. Distinctions spell out how your character is different from others, and they impact every action you take.  

Distinctions aren’t necessarily permanent features of your character forever. Characters often evolve during play. These changes can be expressed through distinctions as well. See [Spending XP](#spending-xp) for rules to rewrite your distinctions.  
  
##### Hindering Distinctions  
  
Every distinction benefits from the ***Hinder*** SFX, your character’s first SFX.  

***Hinder***: Roll a d8 distinction as a d4 to earn a Ⓟ.  

***Hinder*** is best used in situations where a distinction would actually make things harder for the character instead of easier (such as a character raised underground trying to fight in bright direct sunlight), or when no distinction really applies to what you’re trying to do (“I’m a warrior, not a librarian!”). Since ***Hinder*** earns you a Ⓟ, which can be spent to include extra dice in your total, this allows you to accept a temporary disadvantage now in order to succeed more spectacularly later on.  

##### Choosing your Distinctions  

Start making a character by picking three distinctions, one from each of the option categories listed below. Each of these options is described in detail in its own section, under [Peoples](#peoples), [Professions](#professions), or [Personas](#personas).  

For your people distinction, choose one of: **Cambion**, **Dwarf**, **Elf**, **Goblin**, **Gnome**, **Halfling**, **Human**, **Ogre**, or **Wyrmkin**.  

For your profession distinction, choose one of: **Bard**, **Cleric**, **Fighter**, **Hexknight**, **Mage**, **Mystic**, **Paladin**, **Ranger**, or **Rogue**.  

For your persona distinction, choose one of: **Cipher**, **Comrade**, **Devotee**, **Disruptor**, **Loose Cannon**, **Mercenary**, **Schemer**, **Valiant**, or **Wholesome**.  

You can either use the distinction name given here or some other version of that name as your distinction. In the full descriptions, each people lists three or more subgroups that you can also use (so your **Elf** character could instead be a **Wood Elf**, **High Elf**, or **Deep Elf**). Similarly, each profession lists a number of subclasses, specialized vocations you might identify with. If you want, you can also add a noun or descriptor to any distinction (as described in the distinctions section of *Cortex Lite*). This means your distinctions could be just as simple as **Cambion**, **Bard**, and **Cipher**, or you could end up with a more detailed list of three distinctions like **Wood Elf**, **Illusionist Wizard**, and **Schemer**, or **Dwarven Grandparent**, **Paladin of the Silver Order**, and **Loyal Companion**.  

Each of your distinctions is rated d8.  
  
#### Attributes  
  
When you need to accomplish something, your six attributes—**Agility**, **Alertness**, **Brains**, **Brawn**, **Charisma**, and **Composure**—are how you get it done.  

**Agility** includes manual dexterity, swiftness, deftness, reflexes, balance, and hand-eye coordination.  

**Alertness** includes perception, intuition, attention, sensory acuity, and overall awareness of your environment.  

**Brains** includes intellect, reasoning, memory, scholarship, and aptitude for learning.  

**Brawn** includes physical strength, constitution, raw muscle, stamina, endurance, athleticism, and general health.  

**Charisma** includes presence, bearing, persuasiveness, social graces, force of personality, and personal magnetism.  

**Composure** includes willpower, self-control, tenacity, discipline, determination, resolve, and the ability to keep your emotions hidden or in-check.  

##### Assigning your Attributes  

You may use the ‘quick attributes’ listed under your character’s people, or you may assign them yourself. If you choose the latter, assign the following to ratings to your attributes, in any order you like: d10, d8, d8, d6, d6, d6. If you wish, once your ratings are assigned you can choose to do either (or both) of the following:  

You may upgrade one d6 attribute to d8, but if you do so, you must also downgrade one d10 attribute to d8 .  

You may upgrade one d8 attribute to d10, but if you do so, you must also downgrade one d6 attribute to d4.  
  
#### Roles  
  
Each of the five roles—**Scholar**, **Scoundrel**, **Scout**, **Soldier**, and **Speaker**—represents a thematic grouping of skills, training, and capabilities. Your largest rated role usually corresponds to how you best contribute to a group, whereas for smaller rated roles, you’re usually better off relying on more proficient allies.  

Thematically, some roles correspond with certain attributes, but attributes tend to represent raw aptitude and talent, while roles are more about focus, pursued interest, and experience.  

**Scholar** is your academic knowledge, including education, lore, deduction, literacy, teaching, and research.  

**Scoundrel** is your aptitude for trickery, crime, spying, sleight of hand, and defeating security measures like traps or alarms.  

**Scout** is your facility for exploration, perception, and survival, including tracking, navigation, animal handling, climbing, and simply noticing things.  

**Soldier** is your skill and experience when it comes to wielding weapons, enduring hardship, providing security, and fighting in general.  

**Speaker** is your affinity for empathy, communication, group dynamics, leadership, and various forms of self-expression, such as oratory, performance, and art.  

Sometimes more than one role might apply. Sneak up on a poacher with **Scout** or **Scoundrel**? Give battlefield orders with **Soldier** or **Speaker**? In those cases, choose the one your character favors.  

##### Assigning your Roles  

You may use the ‘quick roles’ listed under your chosen profession, or you may assign your roles yourself. Assign the following die ratings to your five roles, in any order: d10, d8, d6, d6, d4.  
  
#### Specialties  
  
Specialties are narrow skills that supplement the broad areas of expertise defined by your roles. Unlike attributes or roles, specialties are free-form traits you create yourself. Whenever a specialty applies, you roll it in addition to the appropriate role.  

For example, you might use **Soldier** to display your general prowess with weapons, but you might also have a specialty that you add when using certain types of weapons appropriate to the game’s setting, such as **Swordplay** d6, **Archery** d6, or **Axes** d8. When you follow a trail through a dense forest, your dice pool might not only include **Scout** but also an extra die for your Tracking specialty.  

Though specialties are like more focused versions of roles, there are no limits on what role you must use to include a specialty that suits your action. For example, if you show off your skill with a knife to intimidate someone into answering your questions, your pool might include both your **Speaker** role and a **Knife Fighting** specialty.  
  
##### Selecting your Specialties  
  
You can choose to start a new character with either two or three specialty traits. If you choose two, one is rated at d8 and the other is d6; if you choose three, all three are rated at d6. Examples of appropriate specialties for adventurers like you are listed under your profession.  
  
Specialty Examples  

* **Acrobatics**  
* **Agriculture**  
* **Alchemy**  
* **Arcana**  
* **Archery**

#### Signature Assets  
  
Signature assets represent external factors that characters can rely on for frequent use. Usually, they cover anything that gives you an advantage and isn’t covered by your other trait sets. After character creation, regular assets can become signature assets through play.  

Note that your signature assets do not include all of your character’s gear or other advantages. When something is an asset, it just means that it’s so important to your character’s story that you gain an extra die when using it.  
  
##### Creating your Signature Assets  
  
You can choose to start a new character with either two or three signature assets. If you choose two, one is rated at d8 and the other is d6; if you choose three, all three are rated at d6. More examples of suitable sample assets are listed under your people.  

In addition to those two or three assets, you also start with an extra free d6 asset that all player characters receive: your starting adventurer’s kit, which you describe in a way that suits your character, but which is assumed to contain certain basic items (food, water, rope, light sources, etc.).  
  
##### Kinds of Signature Assets  
  
Most signature assets break down into one of four categories: things, creatures, places, and persons. Example signature assets for each category are listed below.  

Things are the most common form of signature asset, including items or equipment that you own, carry, or have access to, some of which may be magical. Examples include **Magic Carpet**, **Healer’s Kit**, **Personal Spellbook**, **My Family’s Heirloom Sword**, **Hand Crossbow**, **Magnifying Glass**, **Silver-Plated Dagger**, **Bull’s Eye Lantern**, **Iron Shackles**, etc.  

Creatures include pets, mounts, animal companions, familiars, and the like. Examples include **Armored Warhorse**, **Well-Trained Bloodhound**, **My Cat Snowball**, **Ornery Camel**, **Baby Dragon**, **Tamed Pterodactyl**, **Imp Familiar**, etc.  
  
Places represent advantages gained from being in or having knowledge of a certain location. Examples include **Seaside Hideout**, **Private Library**, **My Family’s Tavern**, **Pocket Dimension**, **Hidden Glade**, **Crumbling Cottage**, **My Queen’s Palace**, **Blacksmith Shop**, **Shrine to My God**, etc. It is rare for the travelling, dungeon-delving PCs of *TorchLite* to have place-based signature assets.  

Persons are minor GMCs who can be relied upon to help you, at least occasionally. Examples include **Loyal Squire**, **Minotaur Bodyguard**, **Thieves’ Guild Contact**, **Cunning Servant**, **Psychic Little Sister**, **Wizard Mentor**, **Fence Who Doesn’t Ask Questions**, **Majordomo**, etc.  
  
##### Your Adventurer’s Kit  
  
You carry a kit that includes gear useful in adventuring, all of which can be carried using a backpack or the like. Give your kit a descriptive name and record it as a d6 signature asset.  

If a snappy name is not springing to mind, use the table below. Roll d10 d8 d6 and combine the descriptors that match your die results to randomly generate your adventurer’s kit.  
  
|Roll| Condition| Material| Container|  
|----| -------------| -----------| ----------|  
|1|Patch-Covered|Burlap|Backpack|  
|2 |Bloodied |Sailcloth |Bundle|  
|3 |Brand New|Crococile Skin|Drawstring Pouch|  
|4 |Brightly Dyed|Leather|Pilgrim’s Bag|  
|5 |Road-Worn|Rope Mesh|Rucksack|  
|6 |Scripture-Inscribed|Thick Wool|Satchel|  
|7 |Secondhand|Waxed|Cotton|  
|8 |Sun-Bleached|Woven|Leaves|  
|9 |Well-Maintained|||  
|10|Wine-Stained|||  
  
In play, you can roll this signature asset not only for the container the kit comes in but for the kinds of items that you’d plausibly pull out of a kit so described. You can elaborate a little on what’s inside before you play.  
  
Beyond the basic info, you can use the listed prompts to better define what’s in your kit—if you’re in a hurry, you can just choose the first example listed for each (resulting in the basic example kit described at the end of this section).  

**You’ve got 50 feet or so of rope—what is it made out of?** (Examples: Hemp, silk, flax, lime bast, walrus hide, cedar bark, griffon hair, cattail, nettle, the webbing of a giant spider, etc.).  

**You keep a two-week supply of food that doesn’t easily spoil—what’s your staple?** (Examples: Hardtack, beef jerky, dried apricots, almonds, stockfish, pecorino, chestnuts, trail mix, elvish waybread, etc.).  

**You drink from a reusable container that you can refill with water or other liquids—what does it look like?** (Examples: A stoppered glass water bottle, a hollowed-out calabash, a wineskin you clean and soak in oil after use, a petrified ostrich egg with a corked hole, a pewter flask, etc.).  

**You have 5–6 hours worth of light sources—what lights your way in the dark?** (Examples: Half-a-dozen torches, a lantern with a large wick, oil lamp and refill flask, alchemical crystals that light up on command but melt away after a few hours’ use, etc.).  

**You carry a cheap, quick, and portable means of lighting fires—what is it?** (Examples: A tinderbox, a flint-and-steel striker, a bamboo fire piston, a glowing ember kept hot in a magic locket, sulfur matches made of pinewood, a glass jar with a tiny fire elemental bound inside, etc.).  

**Your kit includes your necessary camping supplies, like portable bedding, something to cook food in, a bowl or dish to eat from, personal soap, and the like—when you travel, which of these items makes you feel most at-home?** (Examples: Heavy canvas bedroll, lavender soap, an ornate silver dish, an old silk pillow, a strigil with aloe vera bathing oil, a thick fur, your mom’s iron cooking pot, a woolen blanket you sewed yourself, etc.).  

A basic example is provided below.  
  
###### Patch-Covered Burlap Backpack  
  
▶ 50-foot hemp rope  
▶ 2 weeks’ ration of hardtack  
▶ Stoppered glass water bottle  
▶ Half-a-dozen torches  
▶ Tinderbox  
▶ Camping supplies (bedroll, etc.)  
  
##### Schrödinger’s Inventory  
  
Unlike in a lot of roleplaying games, *TorchLite* characters don’t need to start play with a long inventory list. Character creation gives you a handful of signature assets, but that doesn’t mean that’s all the cool stuff that will feature in your game.  

You can keep a list of items your character carries that aren’t signature assets. Or, you can use a trick we like to call Schrödinger’s Inventory.  

Adventurers often carry a whole bunch of items that aren’t important enough to be signature assets—or rather, items which aren’t important until circumstances make them so. Think coil of rope, ten foot pole, and torches. The kinds of things are often a part of your adventurer’s kit, but even when they aren’t itemized on the character sheet, they can still feature in your game.  

The default rules of *TorchLite* can handle these just fine through your kit, test-created assets, and spending Ⓟs for assets. You can also include these items without any rules at all.  

You can use test-created assets not only for assets that are literally created in the story, but also to reflect planning and preparation. A PC might dig into their adventurer’s rucksack and pull out some fishing bait—assuming bait is a thing that they would plausibly have been packed. They might roll **Brains**, **Scout**, the distinction Halfling and the signature asset for your adventurer’s kit. The effect die becomes the asset rating.  
  
A player might spend a Ⓟ to produce a fishing bait from their bag, which gets them a d6 asset. This is a good option for when time is too tight to roll a test. Usually the plausibility requirements for a Ⓟ spend are a little more lenient than a foresight-in-packing test, but they’re still there. Pulling out some worms is one thing; pulling out a depleted uranium fuel rod containment unit is quite another.  

But perhaps the most potent trick to cover such needful items is to use no rule at all. When you need to tie up the ork you just defeated, is it really necessary to figure out if you have rope? In a modern game, one assumes that most everybody has a cell phone handy. So too, PCs have basic adventuring gear handy. Especially if it’s not going to be involved in a die roll, no mechanics are necessary.  

When you pick up a mundane item that has enough practical use that you want to keep using it regularly, but it isn’t interesting or important enough to become a signature asset (such as a stick of chalk or a pack of pitons), you can let your GM know you’re adding it to your adventurer’s kit. It’s assumed you restock your kit every couple weeks or so—if you go much longer than that, parts of your kit probably stop being available as you use them up.  
  
But it is a rare *TorchLite* game where “If you don’t have it written on your sheet, you don’t have it.” is a rule. A little common sense and a willingness to bow to narrative flow will let your game focus on questions more interesting than if you remembered your wallet when you left the house this morning.  
  
#### SFX & Limits  
  
Each character has a handful of SFX, reflecting special capabilities associated with their distinctions. A player character also has Limits. A Limit is a special type of SFX that imposes a disadvantage on your character in order to earn them Ⓟs or another reward.  

Whenever you gain an SFX or Limit, you can rename it to better suit your character. In *TorchLite*, your SFX are attached to your distinctions (instead of being attached to roles as they are in *Cortex Lite*).  

Complications named in SFX (such as **Enraged** or **Indulged**) are mere suggestions and can always be swapped for something more creative or appropriate to the moment.  

Some SFX are tagged as (Gear). These generally require you to have the equipment described in the SFX in order to use some or all of the options that SFX offers.  
  
##### Selecting your SFX  
  
Choose three SFX based on your distinctions. These distinctions can be chosen from the SFX listed with your people, those listed with your profession, or the [General SFX](#general-sfx). Your character begins play with the chosen SFX, in addition to the ***Hinder*** SFX all characters receive.  
  
##### Selecting your Limits  
  
Choose two [Limits](#limits) for your character, based on your distinctions. Your profession lists a few suggestions for characters with that distinction, but you can choose any two Limits you wish.  
  
#### Milestones  
  
As you play, your character can gain Experience Points (XP), which can be used to change or augment your traits. You earn XP using milestones, lists of actions or events that advance your character’s story and give them a chance to grow. A character has two milestones at a time. A milestone usually has three levels, each of which provides a different amount of XP and can be tapped for XP at certain times:  

▶ A 1 XP level that you can hit once per beat;  
▶ A 3 XP level that you can hit once per scene;  
▶ And a 10 XP level that you can hit once per session.  
  
Once XP is gained, it can be spent between sessions to change or improve your traits, gain new traits, or unlock other benefits. After you complete the 10 XP level, you remove that milestone and replace it, starting a brand new milestone. (Theoretically, you could choose to send your character on a new version of the same journey by starting the same milestone over again, if you feel it captures an aspect of your character that you’d like to explore more deeply, but it’s usually much more interesting to move on to a new one.)  
  
##### Selecting Your Starting Milestones  
  
All new characters start play with two milestones. By default, these include the milestone listed for your persona distinction, and a custom session milestone provided by the GM. However, you can choose any two appropriate milestones listed in this book or another source. If there isn’t currently a session milestone available, you can default to the *Levelling Up* milestone listed below.  

###### Milestone: Levelling Up  

▶ 1 XP when you earn a Ⓟ from an SFX or Limit (such as ***Hinder***).  
▶ 3 XP when you help someone else recover from stress or you succeed on a roll to create an asset for an ally.  
▶ 10 XP when you recover from stress of d12 or larger, or when an asset you created for someone else helps defeat a challenge that has at least one trait at d12.  
  
#### Completing Your Character  
  
Once you have determined and recorded your distinctions, attributes, roles, specialties, signature assets, SFX, Limits, and milestones, you have all the mechanical elements of your character in place. If you haven’t already, you need to choose your character's name and pronouns. Once this is done, your character is complete!  
  
### Peoples  
  
Choose one of the peoples described in the following pages to represent your character’s ancestral origin. You might also pick one of the subgroups described under your people to further define your character.  
  
#### Tall or Small  
  
The peoples listed here all come in many different shapes and sizes, but certain varieties are specifically described as smallfolk or tallfolk. Smallfolk simply refers to any people or subgroup whose average height is less than 4 feet (120cm) tall, while tallfolk have an average height around 7 feet (210cm) or higher.  

Characters belonging to either group can add the appropriate SFX below to the list of SFX associated with their people. A player can also do the same if they simply want their character to be a good deal smaller or larger than the average size for their people. (Obviously, unless you have a very unique character concept, it likely doesn’t make much sense for one character to have both these SFX.)  

***Smallish:*** Add a d6 to your dice pool for a roll to avoid **Damaged** and step down the largest die in the pool by one, then step up your effect die.  

***Hulking Build:*** Spend a Ⓟ to double **Brawn** on a roll to resist **Exhausted** or to lift, push, drag, or throw something heavy.  
  
#### Cambion  
  
Strange and uncanny, cambions are born into the mortal world, but with an otherworldly lineage. They are always marked; however, while many cambion are horned and possess pointed ears and eyes of inky black, these features are not universal to all. Tails, wings, fangs, hooves, barely discernible haloes, flickering shadows, or faint scents of brimstone or petrichor are other signs of such ancestry. Their skin tones can be any color you can imagine, depending on their ancestry.  

Cambions are rare, and often seen by small-minded folk as exotic at best or dangerously weird at worst. Most come from communities of non-cambion peoples, but more than a few grow up in places where cambions have gathered in settlements of their own. The most frequently encountered cambions (labeled as *fiendtouched* or *nephilim*) have ancestry tied to demons, devils, or the like. Others descend from creatures of the fey realm (sometimes called *feyblooded*), from elemental beings (known as *flamesouls*, *stormsouls*, *icesouls*, *acidsouls*, and *venomsouls*), or even from divine beings like angels or demigods (called *lightborn*).  

Certain cambions resemble humanoid animals. There are also many descendants of the fey who have such features, such as the feline catfolk or the ravenlike kenku, as well as cambions of other lineages. Some sages group together all such peoples under the name *beastkin*.

***Underwater Adaptation:*** Spend a Ⓟ to gain the asset **Amphibious** d8. While you have this asset, you can breathe both air and water and swim as fast as you can walk.  
  
#### Dwarf  
  
Stout and often bearded, dwarves are known for mining, crafting, and carousing, though not necessarily in that order. They tend to be bigger and broader than smallfolk like halflings or gnomes, but shorter than humans and elves. Dwarves are renowned for their primordial connection to earth, metal and stone. Their skin shares the same range of colors as the earth itself, from tans and browns to the gray of granite or the crimson of red clay. Their cultures vary, but all tend to teach the virtues of determination, hard work, and tenacity, even to the point of stubbornness.  

Among other peoples, dwarves have a reputation as implacable enemies and steadfast allies. Their largest communities are those of the *mountain dwarves*, who build great underground cities in caves beneath the tallest peaks. Other dwarven cultures include the *hill dwarves*, whose settlements are better positioned for trade with other peoples, and the *obsidian dwarves*, who have adapted to life in the deepest volcanic tunnels.

#### Elf  
  
Supernaturally graceful, long-lived folk with pointed ears and an innate connection to their wilderness homelands, elves are kin to the fey, born of magic. Not every elf pursues the arcane arts, but none is ever truly mundane; each expresses their mystical nature in one way or another. They tend to be lithe and light on their feet, and tales say the most dextrous elves can stride across thin snowdrifts and flimsy tree branches where others would slip or fall.  

Some of the most well-known elven folk are the *wood elves*, legendary for their subtle and instinctive skill as foresters; the *high elves*, who dwell in hidden refuges where the fey realm meets the mortal world; and the *deep elves*, who build magnificent cities in deep subterranean caverns. The various elven lineages include all the potential skin tones a human might have, plus a few more extreme hues, including the pale bluish-white complexions of some high elves from colder climes and the dark gray or purplish colors common among deep elves.

#### Gnome  
  
Gnomes are cunning tricksters and clockwork inventors with magical talents for secrecy and creativity. Gnomes are descended from the fey and remain close to those roots. Many inherit a spirit of capricious mischief or pursue one idiosyncratic goal with insatiable, single-minded passion. Gnomes are among the smallest of smallfolk, seldom standing more than 3 feet (90cm) tall. They enjoy a wide variety of colorations and features, reflecting the vibrant diversity of the Fey Realm itself, though they can be categorized into a few subgroups.  

*Forest gnomes* favor untamed wildernesses of unchecked vegetation, protected by their connection with nature and secretive illusion techniques. *Fringe gnomes* dwell in their own enclaves near or within larger communities, where they work to combine other cultures’ innovations with their own to invent wondrous devices. The subterranean *fungal gnomes*—called *svirfneblin* in their own tongue—are named for their staple crop, which they farm in vast and deep caverns. Legends of fringe gnomes having created living iron constructs known as *ferrous gnomes* are unconfirmed.

#### Goblin  
  
Goblins are tenacious survivors who tend to be wiry, cunning, and stealthy. They have a wider range of skin tones than humans, with shades of green or red as common among them as brown or gold. History is full of goblin uprisings against oppression. Tyrants and conquerors often see goblins as ideal soldiers and try to press them into service, so most goblins make their homes in hidden places. They have a reputation for teamwork and resilience, for getting out of tight corners by stealth or guile, and for quickly crafting clever weapons out of unlikely materials.  

When most folk refer to goblins, they usually mean *cave goblins*, smallfolk with an uncanny knack for narrow escapes, who build communities in the interstitial spaces between other settlements and cultures. Their human-sized kin, *hobgoblins*, are known for uncanny collaborative instincts and insights into group dynamics, allowing them to coordinate their efforts with allies in extraordinary ways. *Bugbears*, another branch of goblinkind, are tallfolk with a supernatural gift for moving unseen despite their great size.

#### Halfling  
  
Folk of all kinds crave community, good food, and the comforts of hearth and home, but halflings seem to feel the love of these things in their very bones. These smallfolk have a reputation for fitting in wherever they go, whether as the life of the party or just a face in the crowd. Other legends tell of their green thumbs, knack for stealth, or preternatural luck. They look much like humans, with the same range of complexions and features, but at roughly half the size.  

Most halflings are *shirelings*, who tend to spend their lives rooted to stable settlements on fertile farmland where cozy houses are built into hillsides and fresh produce is always plentiful. In such villages, what other folk would consider a legendary feast is seen by the locals as just a casual brunch. There are also migratory clans, such as the *riverfolk* who travel along rivers and coastlines in fleets of watercraft. The halflings known as bladeriders are reclusive hunter-gatherers with a spiritual reverence for the beasts they breed as mounts—whether they are ponies, dire wolves, or even drakes. The lithe and childlike *wanderken* are free-spirited folk whose irrepressible curiosity and impulsive wanderlust tend to get them into constant trouble.

#### Human  
  
As unpredictable as they are diverse, humans are famous for the bewildering variety of their customs, interests, and ways of life. Poets among the dwarves and elves—who enjoy much longer average lifespans—have often mused that humans’ brief lives stoke the fires of ambition, driving them to make their mark on the world as quickly as they can. Their versatility and insatiable urge to explore have made them the most numerous of the world’s peoples.  

Nearly every inhabited region or major city has at least few humans living in it. They exhibit the same range of skin, eye, and hair colors as their kin on Earth, but they are the only one of the world’s peoples who aren't born with any innate magical gifts (unless they have extraordinary ancestry). However, they can still master spellcasting as well as anyone. From grizzled folk of icy climes and seafaring raiders to cosmopolitan city dwellers and nomads of the vast grasslands, humans boast more different cultures and lifestyles than can easily be counted. Some sage categorize human subcultures based on what kind of environment they come from, such as *urban humans* or humans from certain terrains (*coastal*, *desert*, *forest*, *plains*, *mountain*, *swamp*, *wastelands*, or *arctic* folk).

#### Ogre  
  
Tallfolk known for their hulking bodies, dense muscles, skin in shades of grey or green, and intimidating horns or tusks, ogres boast a reputation as powerful comrades and terrifying foes. Ancient myth speaks of deities dividing the new-made world into territories for their favored peoples, leaving ogres with only the inhospitable hinterlands. According to some ogre storytellers, their ancestors accepted this as a challenge, defiantly thriving in shallow caverns, rocky chasms, and sunless swamps. Perhaps owing to these harsh homelands, ogre cultures tend to prize hunting skill, martial prowess, honorable conduct, and strong familial bonds.  
  
The most populous ogre communities are those of the *orks*, whose war hordes can annihilate invading armies in a single battle and cripple even the most powerful kingdoms with lightning raids. *Half-giants* are gray-skinned mountain folk who pursue athletic competitions and other tests of skill with even more intensity than other ogres. Curling horns, furry hide, and pronounced snouts give *minotaurs* a distinctly bovine appearance. An islander and maritime people, minotaurs feature prominently in pirate stories. *Gray ogres* tend to be both the largest and the most reclusive of ogrekind, favoring deep backwoods and caves to shun polite society.

#### Wyrmkin  
  
The legacy of dragons has defined the heritage of many humanoid folk. While separate draconic species differ greatly in their physical traits, they share certain attributes in common, including scaly skin that is thicker in their extremities, horned skulls, taloned hands and feet, reptilian eyes that usually range between red and gold, and laying eggs. Features like wings, tails, resistance to certain forms of harm, and even a dragon’s destructive breath weapon do occur, but differ by population group or even between individuals, as do the colors of the scales.  

In terms of personality, wyrmkin vary as much as any people, yet in every draconic heart, a fire burns. This hunger for greatness echoes the powerful drives of the great dragons themselves. In some, this ambition may manifest as a yearning for glory or respect, in others it might be the urge to conquer or rule. The most well-known wyrmkin are the diminutive, tunnel-dwelling smallfolk called *kobolds* and the saurian *lizardfolk* who favor homelands in marshes or jungles. Another, rarer group are the *draechen*, formidable tallfolk with a knightly culture and mysterious origins.

#### Customizing Your People  
  
You might find that your character idea isn’t fully or accurately defined by a single one of these distinctions. You might have ancestry from multiple peoples, have been born of one people but raised by another, have been touched by strange magic, or simply have grown up differently than is the norm in your culture or subculture. You and the other players might agree to let you imagine a character type of your own not defined here. To make such a character, customize your distinction’s name accordingly, and then work with your GM to decide which SFX accurately represent the background you’re envisioning.  
  
##### Example: Gnolls  
  
For instance, Jeremy is a big fan of the old-school fantasy creatures called gnolls and he wants to play one. In play, he wants to explore the infernal connections they’ve been portrayed as having in the past.  

Gnolls are a special type of fiendtouched cambion, hyena-like tallfolk who exist in greater numbers than other cambions, most of whom travel in nomadic tribal groups. Though ancient pacts bind many gnolls to the service of demons and compel them to mercilessly raid their neighbors, there are also large gnoll communities whose members have escaped this fiendish subjugation.  

Working with his GM, Miriam, Jeremy gives his character the distinction **Gnoll of the Northern Badlands**, and they identify five cambion SFX and five ogre SFX that all seem to make sense for a gnoll PC. During character creation, and as the character grows in his career, Jeremy will choose people SFX from the list he and Miriam agreed on.  
  
### Professions  
  
Choose one of the professions listed in the following pages to define your character’s adventuring vocation.  
  
#### Multi-Profession Characters  
  
Effort has been made to make each of these distinctions as inclusive as possible, but you might decide you want to play a character who practices more than one profession. Perhaps your character went to seminary to pursue their calling as a cleric, but at night they were haunted by a decidedly unholy being who also persuaded them to make a pact and become a hexknight. If so, you can reflect this dichotomy in your distinction name (**Cleric by Day, Hexknight by Night**), and then work with your GM to choose SFX that capture your character’s capabilities.  
  
#### Bard  
  
Wielding skill and spell to support allies and befuddle foes, the bard inspires though performance, artistry, leadership, and lore. Common career paths your bard might pursue include:  

▶ A *troubadour* traipsing from town to town, performing songs, reciting poetry and tales, and bringing news of distant lands.  
▶ A *herald* wearing the colors of their liege, serving as a messenger, diplomat, historian, and arbiter of etiquette.  
▶ A *skald* fighting alongside fierce comrades, a warrior-poet whose songs and chants inspire courageous deeds and preserve epic tales.  
▶ A *loremaster* devoted to academic scholarship, conducting research, educating students, and recording knowledge for posterity.  
▶ A *jongleur*, traveling for applause and coin, performing death-defying acrobatics, knife throwing, juggling, and other crowd-pleasing stunts.

### Personas  
  
Choose one of the personas listed in the next few pages as a distinction. You can use the persona name given here or some other version of it. You can also make your distinction any word or phrase that you feel resonates with the persona. The best persona distinction is the one you find most evocative of the character you want to play.  

Your chosen persona distinction comes with a milestone set. These milestones serve as springboards to introduce your character to the group dynamic.

#### Other Personas  
  
These distinctions capture a wide range of archetypal character types seen in many fantasy stories. However, if none of the distinctions and/or [milestones](#milestones) capture the persona you have in mind. Start by choosing such a milestone (or working with your GM to create an original milestone based on these examples), and then come up with a descriptive persona distinction that reflects the milestone you chose.  
  
##### Aligned Characters  
  
Whether by choice or by fate’s machinations, some characters align with cosmic forces of Law or Chaos, or with the balancing powers in-between. This alignment is not a moral code or ethical ideal; rather, it is a metaphysical orientation, a manifestation of impersonal cosmological influences. In some cases, a character’s conduct and outlook on the world may reflect these influences. You may decide your character has an alignment in the universe’s greater struggle between anarchic entropy and harmonious order. While their persona doesn’t need to correspond with this alignment, if you want it to have an effect, you can consult the table below.  

This table also identifies how mainstream society is likely to categorize a character on a scale of perceived morality. Since mortal ideals often judge people by how much they prioritize either benefiting others (behavior many would label as “good”) or benefiting oneself (more often associated with “evil”), the table lists how folk tend to view the personalities along that spectrum, including which ones are just somewhere in the middle (more “neutral”).  

|               |  Aligned with… |                |               |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| **Perceived as…** | Chaotic Forces | Neutral Forces | Lawful Forces |
|     “Good”    |     Valiant    |    Wholesome   |    Comrade    |
|   “Neutral”   |  Loose Cannon  |     Cipher     |    Devotee    |
|     “Evil”    |    Disruptor   |    Mercenary   |    Schemer    |

### Limits  
  
Choose two of the Limits listed here for your character, based on your distinctions. Your profession lists a few suggested Limits for characters with that distinction, but you can choose any two you wish.  

Like all *Cortex Lite* characters, you also gain the ***Hinder*** Limit for your distinctions.  

#### GM Activation  

Unlike normal SFX, Limits can be activated by the GM as well as the player. Even when the GM does so, you still make all the choices and earn all the rewards listed for that Limit.  

For example, the ***We’ve Got History Limit*** lets you earn a Ⓟ by revealing that a GMC was formerly your friend, ally, or lover. If the GM activates the Limit, you still decide whether the GMC in question was your friend, or your ally, or your lover, and you still earn the Ⓟ. The Limit says you also take d6 **Demoralized** or **Enthralled** stress, but it is you who decides which of those two stresses you take, not the GM.  
  
#### Reveals  
  
Some Limits allow you to reveal information about the scene or setting. When you do so, your character explains a fact about the story that is true, a fact you create just like the GM would. Just as the GM might have a GMC say “These kobolds wear the symbol of the red dragon Infernax”, which establishes a truth about the world for everyone at the table, you have your character say something similar. Either way, the revelation changes the story, editing the narrative of your current scene to make the information you revealed true.  

In the fiction of the game, what your character reveals is based on their existing knowledge or current observations. As a player at the table, however, you actually get to invent these new details for your character to share, creating new information that changes the story.  

Some GMs and players prefer not to use these kinds of Limits. If your group doesn’t want them, you can ignore Limits that call for player reveals.  

All the Limits that explicitly require a player reveal are marked with an asterisk (\*).  
  
##### Limits List  
  
***Ammunition (Limit):*** Earn a Ⓟ and step down an asset for a ranged weapon, representing a need to conserve ammunition.

Whether the asset is stepped down or shut down, recover it when you refresh your ammo supply.

***Tough:*** When you would take **Damaged**, spend a Ⓟ to step down the stress you take. If this steps the stress down below d6, you take no stress at all.  

***Trained Physician:*** Step up or double **Scholar** in your dice pool when helping others recover **Damaged**. You can also spend a Ⓟ to step down your own or a nearby character’s **Damaged**.  

***Transmutation Studies:*** Take **Exhausted** d6 to step up **Scholar** when rolling to magically alter the form or physical properties of creatures of objects. If your roll succeeds, step up your effect die.  

***Undaunted Determination:*** Step up or double **Scout** for one roll. If the roll fails, take **Exhausted** stress equal to the largest die in your pool.  

***Versatile Grip (Gear):*** When you roll to use a weapon that can be wielded one-handed or two-handed, if you wield it with two hands, you can double your attribute. If you fail, step up the stress you take from failing.  

***Vicious Contempt:*** When you roll to inflict **Demoralized** with mockery or contempt, add d6 and step up your effect die.  

***Vigilant Eye:*** Spend a Ⓟ to double **Scout** in a pool related to following a trail, aiming at a distant target, or spotting something far off.  

***Watch It All Burn:*** Add a die to your pool equal to the largest stress or complication anyone has in the scene and step up your effect die. Succeed or fail, you take **Enthralled** d6.  

***Wicked Feint:*** When you succeed on a roll to inflict **Enthralled**, keep a second effect die as **Damaged** against the same foe.  

***What’s the Worst That Can Happen:*** When you roll to create an asset for a desperate or dubious plan of action, explain to another character what the worst-case failure scenario looks like to step up your largest die and step up your effect die. The GM sets aside a die equal to your effect die, which they can assign to you later as a complication if you fail at executing the plan.  
  
### Spending XP  
  
Once experience points are earned via Milestones, they can then be spent for the benefit of your character. *TorchLite* uses the following table for the most common uses of Experience Points:  

Spend 1 XP to:  

▶ Start the next game session with one extra Ⓟ. (You can’t start a game session with more than 5 Ⓟs.)  

Spend 3 XP to do one of the following:  

▶ Replace an existing distinction with a new one.  
▶ Add or replace a Limit.  
▶ Add a new d4 specialty or signature asset  
▶ Upgrade an existing specialty or signature asset from d4 to d6.  

Spend 5 XP to do one of the following:  

▶ Add a new d6 specialty.  
▶ Convert a temporary asset into a d6 signature asset.  
▶ Replace an existing SFX with a new one.  

Spend 10 XP to do one of the following:  

▶ Upgrade a d4 role to d6.  
▶ Add a new d6 signature asset.  
▶ Upgrade an existing d6 specialty or signature asset to d8.  

Spend 15 XP to do one of the following:  

▶ Upgrade a d6 attribute or role to d8.  
▶ Upgrade an existing d8 specialty or signature asset to d10.  
▶ Add a new SFX.  

Spend 20 XP to do one of the following:  

▶ Upgrade a d8 attribute or role to d10.  
▶ Upgrade an existing d10 specialty or signature asset to d12.  

Spend 25 XP to:  

▶ Upgrade a d10 attribute or role to d12.  
  
#### How Distinctions Evolve  
  
The starting spreads of distinctions in *TorchLite* are very simplistic and can be elaborated as you play. Here’s three methods you can use whenever you spend XP:  
  
##### Combining Distinctions  
  
When you want a new distinction (3 XP), you may combine existing distinctions to make room. The two distinctions Elf and Wizard can be combined into one distinction, Elf Wizard. The SFX from both these distinctions get listed under the combined distinction. The new distinction goes into the newly freed-up space.  

There is no hard limit to how many times distinctions can be combined, but you should always aim for distinction names that have a sort of holistic sense to them, and aren’t just a grab-bag of miscellaneous traits.  
  
##### Rewriting Distinctions  
  
Replacing an SFX (5 XP) or adding a new SFX (15 XP) also allows you to add to or rewrite the distinction or asset that it is attached to. A character with Elf who is adding the Glade Keeper SFX might rewrite the distinction to Wood Elf.  

As your character’s backstory develops, you can incorporate its geographical places: Frostheim Dwarf, Cavetown Gob, Human of the Dale. New SFX can also flesh out that backstory, such as adding the Cataphract SFX and explaining that the humans of the Dale are known for their equestrianism.  

If the SFX reflects new training or institutional access, you might revise a distinction by adding the place or faction that taught you: Highchurch Cleric, Midnight Academy Hexknight.  

##### Replacing Distinctions  

You can also replace distinctions as normal. Not having the Elf distinction doesn’t mean your character is no longer an elf; it just means you’ve decided that being an elf isn’t one of the most important parts of your character’s story.  
  
#### Epic Characterization, One Bite at a Time  
  
One of the great joys of fantasy roleplaying is the sense that you are a fascinatingly complex character, deeply intertwined with an epic story playing out in a vast and colorful world. You struggle against challenges, you have terrible moral quandaries, you grow and change as a person and as a heroic figure in the setting. This may seem like an intimidating goal for something you do with your buddies in your free time, but evolving your distinctions can help you get there without a lot of fuss.  

Starting *TorchLite* characters are built out of parts that are not just basic, but reductive. Starting distinctions of “Scheming Elf Fighter” may feel insufficient to fully describe your character, and that’s on purpose. Starting distinctions aren’t intended as the final word on your character—they’re the first words on your character. Introducing your character in the first session focuses on the broad strokes: Scheming. Elf. Fighter. That’s all you need to start.  

The trick here is that as you play, you get to know your character. As you make decisions based on those distinctions—to roll as a d8 or d4, is this an Elf thing or a Scheming thing, and so on—you’re developing a more nuanced understanding of your character’s distinctions. And the best part is, this requires no intention on your part. It just happens, over and over again, because of how the game works.  

Eventually you’ll want to add an SFX to one of these reductive distinctions you’ve been using. And that’s when you can pivot the trait’s reductive name to something more precise. If you’re adding the ***Seasoned Sea Dog*** SFX to Elf, maybe you rename that distinction to Sea Elf. If you’re adding Veteran **Soldier**, maybe you’re not so much a Fighter as you are a Mercenary. Or maybe the SFX you’re adding isn’t related, but you’ve discovered through play that Schemer isn’t as accurate as Tactician would be.  

You may have started out with a rough sketch of a Scheming Elf Fighter, but you’ve discovered through play that your character is more accurately described as a Sea Elf Mercenary Tactician.  

This works outside of distinctions, too. Shifting dice between roles can refine your sense of their competencies. Adding specialties allows you to highlight specific aspects of their training or background. Turning assets that you found on an adventure into signature assets that stick around cement the character’s place in the unfolding story.  

As you play, your character develops from reductive tropes to specific characteristics, becoming a fleshed-out, three-dimensional character. Each little in-the-moment choice is simple, almost petty. Looking back, though, you might recognize the game as a process of figuring out what it means to be an elf, in this world, in this story, at that table.  

You are also collaborating with the GM; see [Epic Worldbuilding, One Bite at a Time](#epic-worldbuilding-one-bite-at-a-time).  
  
#### Additional Milestones  
  
These are examples of individual milestones one PC might take on based on their own more personal journey or story arc, and which they might pursue while also assisting their allies in a larger quest. You can also reference these as examples when creating milestones of your own.

### Quick Character Creation  
  
You can quickly generate an entire, playable *TorchLite* character by making three and a half choices. Each of these choices give you a distinction—a core trait of your character—and then a number of other traits that populate your character file.  

You don’t need to understand any of the moving parts, here: just follow the steps to get a character that is ready to play. After you’ve played a session or three and understand how things go together, it is a simple matter to modify your character and fine-tune your experience going forward.  

This option is ideal for getting right into play. For a more detailed option, see the full rules for [Character Creation](#character-creation).  
  
#### Choice 1: Pick a People  
  
The people from whom you descended and who probably raised you are your people. This lineage gives you a set of cultural competencies and characteristics associated with that people (which you’ll also flesh out in play). This choice defines your basic body shape and determines how most mortals will perceive you.  

Choose one: cambion, dwarf, elf, goblin, gnome, halfling, human, ogre, or wyrmkin  

Your people choice gives you a distinction, an SFX, your attributes, and your signature assets.  

▶ Write the name of your people in the first Distinction slot on your character file.  
▶ Copy the Typical SFX from your people’s spread onto your character file, under your people distinction.  
▶ Copy the Quick Attributes from your people’s spread onto your character file.  
▶ Gain the top three signature assets listed on your people’s spread. Each is rated at d6.  
▶ Your character also begins play with an adventurer’s kit signature asset. Copy the [sample adventurer’s kit](#patch-covered-burlap-backpack) and rate it at d6.  

A quick reminder on signature assets: remember, these aren’t the only items your character has in hand when they begin their first adventure. They are merely the most important, which is why they have a die rating. Your character can also be assumed to have other incidental items that would be plausible for them to carry. Those items just don’t get dice.  
  
#### Choice 2: Pick a Profession  
  
Adventurers begin play with at least a little training—formal or otherwise—in a broadly-defined profession. This includes basic skills and background knowledge. It also implies connection to, if not formal membership in, organizations and institutions in the setting, such as churches for clerics or theives guilds for rogues.  

Choose one: bard, cleric, fighter, hexknight, mage, mystic, paladin, ranger, or rogue.  

Your profession choice gives you a distinction, two SFX, your limits, your roles, and your specialties.  

▶ Write the name of your profession in the second Distinction slot on your character file.  
▶ Copy the two Typical SFX from your profession’s spread onto your character file, under your profession distinction.  
▶ Copy the names of the first two Limits listed on your profession’s spread, and then copy the rules for those limits from the [Limits](#limits).  
▶ Copy the Quick Roles from your people’s spread onto your character file.  
▶ Gain the top three specialties listed on your profession’s spread. Each is rated at d6.  
  
#### Choice 3: Pick a Persona  
  
At the core of your character, deeper than the lineage of their people or the training of their profession, is their persona. This is a short descriptor of how they act, think, and move through the world.  

Chose one: cipher, comrade, devotee, disruptor, loose cannon, mercenary, schemer, valiant, wholesome.  

As essential as this choice is, it is also fundamentally changeable, and you might later have a change of heart (or a series of them) which changes your persona. This choice is only for how your character will start play.  

Your persona choice gives you a distinction and your first milestone.  

▶ Write the name of your persona in the third Distinction slot on your character file.  
▶ Copy the milestone listed on your Persona’s entry.  
▶ For your second milestone, ask the GM for the session milestone for the next or current adventure. If the GM doesn’t have one (or if you don’t have a GM), take the Levelling Up milestone.  
  
#### Choice 3½: Pick Name and Pronouns  
  
Lastly, decide the name and pronouns that your character gives to their fellow adventurers. There’s no pick list here; the sky’s the limit!  
  
#### Okay But What If I Want…  
  
As you copy things over onto your character file, you might want something a little different. Maybe a little more of one trait or a little less of another. Maybe not this SFX but another one from the same spread. Luckily, there is a little wiggle room.  

▶ For signature assets, you may select any two from your people spread, not just the top two.  
▶ For specialties, you may select any three from the Professions spread, not just the top three.  
▶ Within each trait set (Attributes, Roles, Specialties, Signature Assets), you may step up one trait while stepping down another. You may only do this once per set, and doing so cannot step up any trait to larger than d10.  
▶ Instead of taking the default SFX, you may take any other SFX on the same page spread.  
▶ Instead of taking the default Limits, you may take any other Limits listed on the same page spread.  
  
## A World of Dangerous Challenges  
  
Colorful, daring characters are only one half of the formula for thrilling adventures. You also need to have exciting and dangerous things for those characters to do and the larger context of a world to give their risky exploits weight and consequence. *TorchLite* supplies grist for the adventuring mill by providing challenges; confronting those challenges by playing the game creates the world around your characters and their adventures.  
  
### A Few GM Rules for *TorchLite*  
  
There’s more to GMing a game than learning the rules, but assuming you’ve got a handle on the basics outlined in What is *TorchLite*, the few extra rules the GM needs to moderate the game appear in this section.  
  
#### Scene Framing  
  
*TorchLite* gives players a lot of power over their characters and what happens to them. The GM isn’t an omnipotent narrator, just another player with specialized responsibilities, portraying the world and the creatures in it rather than one special character of their own. However, one major power the GM possesses is that they are the one who frames scenes.  

To frame a new scene, the GM makes decisions based on the story so far. They determine where it happens, who is present, and what is already happening when the PCs arrive.  

While you might have a rough plan, avoid all expectations as to how a scene might end or what the player will choose to do. Include elements you think will spur the PCs into action, but the goal isn’t to move players along a predetermined track; play to find out what happens.  
  
#### GM Plot Points  
  
When a GM activates a hitch, or when a PC gains a Ⓟ from using ***Hinder*** or a Limit, those plot points come from an infinite pile of plot points no one at the table needs to worry about monitoring or controlling. When players activate a GM opportunity, these Ⓟ go back to that pile.  

However, when the GM wants to spend plot points to help a GMC (perhaps by adding more dice to a total or keeping extra effect dice) or to use an SFX, they have their own bank of plot points they need to spend from.  

The GM’s plot point bank starts with a number of plot points equal to the number of PCs. The GM can add more plot points by using certain SFX (such as ***Hinder*** for GMCs that have distinctions).  
  
#### Scene Distinctions  
  
Each scene can be framed with up to three scene distinctions, special traits that any character in the scene can include in their rolls. Scene distinctions are rated at d8, and can be used to earn plot points with ***Hinder***.  

If a character has distinctions of their own, the player chooses whether to use a scene distinction or one of their character distinctions for each roll. In *TorchLite*, a player has the option to use both a scene distinction and character distinction on the same roll, as long as they use ***Hinder*** on one of the two distinctions.  
  
### Game Moderator Characters  
  
*TorchLite* adventurers traverse a world of hungry predators, perilous dangers, and looming threats. Some are meant to be challenging opposition, but others are bit parts and recurring secondary characters, so there are different ways of creating GMCs.  

GMCs are split into three different types depending on the role you expect them to fulfill in the story: Extras, Analog GMCs, and Challenge Pools.  

Extras can be created as needed during play. Analog GMCs and Challenge Pools work best for recurring characters who harry the player characters across multiple adventures. These may start as Extras or as Boss challenge pools; you can switch their type between sessions, and even use them as an Analog GMC for a few adventures and then turn them into a Boss for a final showdown.  

#### Extras  

An extra is a nameless character in a scene who has just one trait describing their role in the story, like Bored Guard d10 or Suspicious Shopkeeper d6. This trait is added to other dice pools rather than rolled on its own. When extras take a complication or stress larger than their trait die, they are taken out. Most extras are invented during play rather than created in advance.  

#### Analog GMCs  

These are created much the same way you’d make a player character, although they can be simplified from that format. For example, instead of defining every trait in a trait set, they might only have the traits they are likely to use. Analog GMCs may have whatever number of SFX or Limits seem appropriate (though generally not more than the GM can easily keep track of). They are taken out with stress or complications in the same way as a PC.  

#### As Challenge Pools  

A challenge pool is something the PCs have to deal with, and not only can it represent a GMC, but also a hazard, dilemma, crisis, or anything else that could be an obstacle to the characters’ progress. Challenge pools are the basic building blocks of *TorchLite* adventures, and they are described in their own section.  

#### Upgrading GMCs  

If a GMC’s importance grows beyond initial expectations, you can always switch their type between sessions as the developing story requires. You can even convert a GMC into a challenge pool or vice-versa.  

### GMCs and Dice Pools  

When a PC rolls a test where a GMC might interfere with or oppose that roll, the GM can add one or more GMC traits to the difficulty dice before rolling.  

If a PC acts directly against an analog GMC or challenge pool, the GM usually builds a dice pool based on traits just as a PC would and rolls that as opposition, instead of bothering with difficulty dice.  

#### Challenge Pools  

A challenge pool represents a complex and difficult situation that requires sustained effort to overcome, rather than any single action. It can represent any crisis or series of obstacles the PCs face: a forest fire, breaking into a vault, evading angry guards, dispelling complex magical wards, rescuing people from a collapsing structure, steering a raft down rocky rapids, fighting a dragon, etc. Powerful foes or groups of enemies can also be represented by challenge pools.  

Challenge pools are the basic structure around which *TorchLite* adventures are built. A handful of challenge pools (including bunch of mobs, and one or two bosses, as described in this section) is all you need for a fun excursion into danger for riches and glory.  

The core of every challenge is a pool of dice that the players will step down and remove as they address the situation. This is its Challenge trait. The challenge remains a driving element of the story until the last die is removed from its pool.  

#### Opposing the Challenge Pool  

Player characters can use their action to reduce the challenge pool. When they do so, the entire challenge pool is rolled as a reaction against them. Usually, a PC tries to reduce the challenge pool by inflicting some kind of complication or stress on it.  

However, challenge pools don’t actually gain complications or stress, nor do they gain assets. Whenever a PC would inflict stress or a complication on a challenge pool, the player instead compares their effect die to a challenge pool die of their choice. If the complication or stress is bigger than that die, that die leaves the pool. If it isn't, the chosen die steps down. Similarly, whenever a challenge pool would gain an asset, that asset immediately converts into a new challenge die instead. When the last challenge die is removed, the challenge is defeated.  

Trying to reduce a challenge pool is risky, however. Failing a roll to do so inflicts stress on the PC, just as failing a test would, but instead of a d6, the GM can choose to inflict the challenge pool’s effect die as stress.  

Also, when a player hitches against a challenge pool, instead of giving the player a Ⓟ, the GM may spend a die from the pool’s challenge trait to turn the hitched die into a complication on the PC.  
  
#### Challenge Pool Actions  

The PCs face challenge pools in action order, and once every PC has had a turn, the challenge pool gets a turn as well. Usually, it rolls to inflict stress or create a complication, but it can also roll to create an asset for itself (which becomes a new challenge die).  

Instead of rolling, the challenge can use its turn to step up its smallest die or grant the GM a Ⓟ. The GM narrates how the challenge escalates or worsens, and then play moves on.  

Finally, the GM can use the pool's turn to spend a die from the challenge trait and move a PC’s complication to the challenge pool to replace it. The PC no longer has the complication, but the problem they were dealing with is now everybody’s problem! (Obviously, the optimal use of this move by the GM would be replacing a smaller die with a larger one.)  

##### Clockwork Defenses  

*This gauntlet of traps and automatons defends the entrance of the vault.*  

**Challenge Pool** d8 d8 d8  

**Spring-Loaded Spikes** d6  
**Automaton Swordsmen**  d10  
**Automaton Archers**  d10  

***Tick Tock:*** gain a Ⓟ when you describe the defenses’ movements as stilted or programmed; any player attempting to predict its attacks or movements may step up their effect die for free.  

***Brassy:*** step down any stress inflicted by blades, spearpoints, or other sharp weapons.  

#### GMCs vs Challenges?  

If a challenge pool works against a GMC, or vice-versa, or if GMCs work against each other, the GM has two choices. They can let a PC roll determine the outcome, or they can simply decide what happens. GMs never roll dice against themselves.  

### Building Challenges  

The GM creates the challenge pool by choosing three to six dice of the same size, from d6 to d12. Die size describes difficulty, while the number of dice roughly determines how long the challenge will last.  

A d6 d6 d6 challenge pool will probably be quick and easy, while a pool of d12 d12 d12 d12 d12 d12 is likely to be long and difficult.  

If you wish, you can also give a challenge pool other traits or SFX, just like a GMC, but that isn’t necessary if you’d rather keep things simple for yourself during play.  

#### Mobs  

A mob is a challenge pool variant representing a group of opposing characters or creatures: a pack of werewolves, a gang of thugs, pirates, rioting city guards, summoned demons, etc. A mob’s challenge pool is called its Mob Dice and this trait sometimes gets a colorful name.  

Instead of stepping down its dice, mobs take complications like GMCs. When a complication steps up past the Mob Trait’s die size, the mob loses a die from that trait and the complication is eliminated. When Mob Trait loses its last die, it is taken out.  

A mob also has signature assets in addition to its mob dice (like those of a minor GMC), which it can add to its rolls. Mobs can also have SFX, and most have at least one SFX like All-Out Attack, Area Spell, or Impossible to Ignore that allow the mob to target multiple characters on its action.  

#### Bosses  

A boss is a variation that represents one GMC meant to challenge multiple PCs at once. A boss works exactly like a mob except that instead of a Mob Dice trait, it has Boss Dice trait.  

#### Using Challenge Templates  

You can quickly and easily make an adventure’s spread of challenge pools by using challenge templates. A template is comprised of a name and description, a list of signature assets, and possibly SFX.  

The next two sections provide templates for a number of monsters, traps, and hazards. All are designed to be modified, torn apart, and put back together to suit your purposes.  

The traits listed in a template may have ratings, but these are always suggestions. Part of the GM’s job is deciding what ratings to assign to the adventure’s challenge pools to tailor the challenge to the adventure and the adventurers.  

#### Levelling Challenges  

Tailoring dice ratings is more art than science. A challenge pool with fewer dice takes less time than a challenge pool with more. A challenge pool of larger dice will take more time still and will also require the PCs to tap more resources and push harder to bring down those dice. Larger ratings of signature assets, which rarely change, make the challenge harder still.  

Additionally, the player characters may have traits and SFX that make them more effective against specific threats. A paladin exorcist is going to clear a mob of ghosts much faster than they would an equally-rated mob of wargs on the hunt.  

The best way to crack this chestnut is play. Throw a d6 d6 d6 d6 d6 mob at the players, followed by a d8 d8 d8 d8 challenge, and then a d10 d10 d10 boss. Jot down notes as to how quickly they go down. Iterate for the next adventure. You will very shortly develop a good sense, not only of how long and difficult any given encounter will play out, but how well it fits into your friends’ expectations of play and attention spans.  

#### Challenging SFX  

Here are a couple additional SFX that are well-suited for challenge pools:  

***Fear Monger:*** When you roll to inflict **Demoralized**, spend a Ⓟ to affect multiple targets. For each additional target, add d6 and keep an extra effect die.  

***Overwhelming Tenacity:*** When you roll to inflict **Exhausted**, spend a Ⓟ to affect multiple targets. For each additional target, add d6 and keep an extra effect die.  

### GMC Drives  

In addition to its boss dice or mob dice and its other traits, GMC challenge pools can be equipped with two drives. Drives are major personality traits that motivate a character. When a drive fuels its actions, the GMC can include that drive in its roll, but it can’t include more than one drive in the same pool.  

A drive consists of a short statement, such as **Drive: Liberate the Tribe**, **Drive: Earn Others' Respect for My Achievements**, or **Drive: Defend Our Lair**. For the most variety, utility, and dramatic interest, each pair of drives is designed so that the two motivations conflict with each other as much as possible. Drives are a useful trait to assign to any GMC, especially if that GMC is going to be a part of the game beyond a single scene.  

A creature’s interactions with the PCs can change the size of its drives, assuming the creature sticks around after its initial interaction with the PCs.  

#### Evolving Drives  

After the PCs engage with a GMC that has drives, at the end of the scene (or the end of session, depending on how quickly the GM wants the situation with that GMC to evolve), the GM can step up one drive (to a maximum of d12), but must also step one drive down (to a minimum of d4). If a PC won a conflict against that GMC, the GM can ask them to decide which drive would step up. Either way, the choice of which drives step up or down should reflect the events that took place.  

These changes to drive die ratings are permanent until another effect alters them. Once a drive steps up to d12, that GMC emerges as a fully-realized major enemy, rival, or ally of the PCs, deeply motivated to pursue that drive at all costs.  

While a GMC has a d12 drive, the GM can step that drive back down to d10 at any time to end a scene in way that favors that GMC. This could allow a GMC to make an impossible escape, rescue and important character, defeat or capture a number of enemies, achieve a startling victory, attain a new level of power or influence, assume their final form, split up a group, conquer or destroy a crucial location, etc. However, it can’t take out a PC or change the outcome of a previous conflict.  
  
### Monster Templates  
  
The following pages present sample monstrous creatures for *TorchLite* games. They are all presented as mobs or bosses, but they can also be converted to analog GMCs. When you roll for these creatures, you include all their mob or boss dice, a drive, and any or all of their signature assets that apply.  

A few of these GMC templates are presented as members of a certain people. Their people is noted in parentheses and they have a matching people SFX. You can make a GMC from a different people by simply replacing that SFX with one from another people.  

Many of these templates first appeared in the Manual of Monsters, Minions, and Mountebanks, which can be found on [itch.io](https://ljrstudiosouth.itch.io/monsters).

***Heritage of Stone (Dwarf):*** When you roll to resist **Exhausted**, to work metal or stone, or to avoid a complication that involves pushing or poisoning you, add d6 and step up your effect die.  
  
#### Young Copper Dragon  
  
*Sociable yet selfish draconic trickster, eager to build a hoard and growing more powerful by the day.*  

**Boss Dice:** d8 d8 d8 d8 d8  

**Drive: Amuse & Trick With Wit** d8  
**Drive: Plunder & Steal Worked Metal** d8  

**Acidic Bite** d10  
**Corrosive Claw** d6  
**Deception** d8  
**Instinctive Senses** d8  
**Resilience** d6  
**Powerful Brawn** d10  
**Stealth** d6  

***Immunities:*** When a roll would inflict stress or a complication on you from acid, step down that roll’s effect die against you. You can also spend a Ⓟ to ignore the stress or complication entirely.  

***All-Out Attack:*** Spend a Ⓟ to target multiple opponents when you roll to inflict **Damaged**. For each additional target, add a d6 and keep an extra effect die.  

***Acid Breath:*** When you use your All-Out Attack SFX, add d8 for each additional target instead of a d6 and choose **Damaged**, then shut down this SFX. Step down your **Resilience** asset to recover.  
  
#### Zombie Swarm  
  
*Horde of mindless, flesh-eating undead.*  

**Mob Dice:** d6 d6 d6  

**Drive: Brains!!!** d8  
**Drive: Slumber** d8  

**Mindless Hunger** d4  
**Shambling Strikes** d6  

***All-Out Attack:*** Spend a Ⓟ to target multiple opponents when you roll to inflict **Damaged**. For each additional target, add a d6 and keep an extra effect die.  

***Immunities:*** When a roll would inflict stress or a complication on you from poison or a weapon attack that doesn’t target your head, step down that roll’s effect die against you. You can also spend a Ⓟ to ignore the stress or complication entirely.  

***Unliving:*** When your **Damaged** or **Exhausted** would step up past d12, you can instead keep it at d12, and you take a d10 Reanimating complication.  

***Infectious Bite:*** When you inflict **Damaged**, spend a Ⓟ or a mob die to inflict a Zombie Infection d6 complication on the same target. A character with a Zombie Infection complication cannot recover **Damaged** and takes **Damaged** equal to the complication at the end of each scene. A Zombie Infection complication doesn’t go away until it is cured by magic or other extraordinary means.  
  
### Trap & Hazard Templates  
  
Whether they are intentional traps or environmental hazards, *TorchLite*’s challenge mechanics turn them into an engaging scene. When you roll for these challenges, you include all their challenge dice as well as any or all of their signature assets that apply.  
  
#### Corridor of Deadly Traps  
  
*It’s one long, empty corridor… except for all the bodies.*  

**Challenge Dice:** d6 d6 d6 d6 d6 d6 d6 d6  

**Distracting Frescoes** d6  
**Hidden Poisoned Dart Guns** d8  
**Seamless Pressure Plates** d10  

***Pit Trap!:*** Whenever a player rolls a hitch in the corridor, the floor falls away to reveal a pit trap lined with spikes; give the player a Ⓟ and gain the asset Pit Trap d8, or Another Pit Trap d8, or similar.  
  
#### Drowning Chamber  
  
*The door is sealed, the tide is rising, and the air is escaping.*  

**Challenge Dice:** d10 d10  

**Rising Water** d4 (or Sand or Oil or Whatever)  
**Sealed Entrance** d8  
**Hard-to-Reach Spouts** d6  

***Suffocation, Super Suffocation:*** On any roll, assign an additional effect die one step larger than Rising Water to step up that asset. If it is already d12, inflict **Damaged** d6 on all players, instead.  
  
#### Foreign Riddle  
  
*Solve the riddle, push the right stone button, and get through, easy peasy.*  

**Challenge Dice:** d6 d6 d6  

**Cunning Riddle** d6  
**Forgotten Dialect** d8  
**Counter-intuitive Stonework UI** d6  

***But in the Latin Alphabet…:*** When a player rolls a hitch and gains stress, inflict a **Damaged** d6 as well.  
  
#### Incomplete Statuary Gallery  
  
*It’s a gallery of six stone figures, but there’s something not quite right…*  

**Challenge Dice:** d8 d8 d8 d8  

**Worn, Obscured Features** d6  
**Notably Empty, Reaching Hands** d6  

***Fill Their Hands:*** When players put items in the hands of statues, the challenge gains the item as an asset. If the item is already an asset, they gain it at that die size; otherwise, gain it at d6. The challenge cannot lose its last die until all statues hold an item.  

***Wrong Answer:*** Once all statues have been given an item, any failure animates them to attack by throwing their items at the characters. The challenge takes its turn immediately; select additional effect dice by giving their targets a Ⓟ.  

***Completion:*** Once all statues have been given an item and players succeed in a roll, additional effect dice to reduce the chalenge pool are free. The exit rumbles with each die removed and is passable when the pool is reduced to zero.  

*Variation:* As written, this challenge is ambiguous on what the correct answer may be. This challenge can be run with a predetermined correct answer by modifying Wrong Answer and Completion to activate on the correct answer rather than success or failure.  
  
#### Mysterious Lock  
  
*An ingenious stonework tableau with iconic figurines that can shift along inset grooves to different areas of the image.*  

**Challenge Dice:** d12 d12 d12  

**Childlike Iconography** d8  
**Heavy Stone Figures** d6  

***Recollection:*** Players may roll to remember details of the adventure leading up to this challenge which provide clues to the lock’s correct answers. When they do, they may give the challenge a Ⓟ to add Childlike Iconography to their pool. On success, assign effect dice to reduce challenge dice or create assets for the clues.  

***I Know This One:*** When a player moves a piece to the correct position, remove the largest die from the challenge pool. If they do so as part of their roll, their effect die may recover **Demoralized** stress or create a Hope asset.  

***Mocking Simplicity:*** On its turn, the Mysterious Lock rolls to inflict **Demoralized** on a character confronting its challenge. If successful, it may freely spend additional effect dice to step up any of its own challenge dice smaller than d12.  
  
#### Storm the Castle  
  
*A stalwart edifice keeping antagonists safe and adventurers out.*  

**Challenge Dice:** d10 d10 d10  

**Stout Walls** d10  
**Barred Gates** d6  
**Defending Archers** d10  
**Meurtrières** d8  

***Boiling Pitch:*** Defenders can pour boiling pitch through the meurtrières up to three times. This inflicts **Damaged** as normal and a second effect die inflicts **Sticky Pitch Burns** d6. The latter requires special treatment to recover.  

***Coordinated Fire:*** Castle defenders preferentially attack siege weapon assets; step up the effect die on any attempt to eliminate them. Siege weapon assets are doubled against this challenge.  
  
#### Traversing the Rapids  
  
*The water churns and boils across treacherous rocks—do you spy a way across?*  

**Challenge Dice:** d6 d6 d6 d6  

**Sharp Rocks** d10  
**Swirling Eddies** d10  
**Jagged Flotsam** d8  

***Splash!:*** Player hitches may get them the complication Swept Up in the Current. The complication may be recovered as normal or a player may sacrifice an asset of equal or larger die size to eliminate the complication. While anyone is Swept Up in the Current, the challenge cannot lose its last die.  

***Floating Hinder:*** Whenever players roll to move, you may roll Jagged Flotsam as a d4 and gain a Ⓟ.  

*Variation:* If the characters are being pursued and need to cross now, add the signature asset Harrying Pursuers d8  
  
#### Treacherous Labyrinth  
  
*Cloven hooves echo through a multi-level construction of stone walls, stairs, and corridors.*  

**Challenge Dice:** d6 d6 d6 d6 d6 d6  

**Twisting Pathways** d10  
**Obstructed Sight Lines** d8  
**The Minotaur Guardian** d4  

***Dead End!:*** Whenever any player removes a die from the Challenge pool, inflict **Demoralized**  d6 on each player in the labyrinth and give them a Ⓟ.  

***He’s Got Your Scent:*** When you activate a player hitch, instead of inflicting stress or complication, you may step up **The Minotaur Guardian**. If **The Minotaur Guardian** is at d12, the Challenge immediately takes its turn.  

***We Lost Him:*** While **The Minotaur Guardian** is d12, players may roll a test to escape pursuit instead of removing a die from the Challenge pool. On a success, **The Minotaur Guardian** steps down to d6.  

***All Mazes Have Exits:*** Whenever a player scores a heroic success, they may keep an additional effect die for free to recover any character’s **Demoralized** stress.  
  
### Session Milestones  
  
*TorchLite* is geared towards goal-oriented group play. Session milestones are the measure and reward to reinforce this. As a GM, session milestones also help you to keep the PCs’s motives centered in your planning. If you find yourself imagining an awesome scene where the PCs joust on griffon-back, but then realize that said jousting doesn’t help the characters advance their goal of freeing the imprisoned rebellion leaders, you know you either have to directly tie that scene into the objective or save the idea for a future adventure.  

The GM will usually present one based on upcoming adventures. The players and GM should look the milestone over and adjust by group preferences. For example, if the PCs are tasked with safely escorting a young noble to safety in the midst of a civil war, the GM could suggest the In Harm’s Way milestone, which rewards the PCs for acting to protect a person who needs it—but instead of referencing a generic “someone”, the milestone could be customized to be about that specific GMC.  

Once a GM has mastered how these examples work, they can refer to them for guidance when making new session milestones or customizing existing ones to reflect their own adventure ideas.  

The 10 XP step of a milestone is often a capstone, representing the end of a story arc. Generally, the capstone is written so that the PC doesn’t have to succeed to earn XP; a character can also grow from failure or from making an interesting choice.

### Running an Adventure  
  
Running a *TorchLite* game is something of an art form—but like any other artform, it has a number of techniques that you can use to build a satisfying experience. What follows are some of those techniques.  
  
#### Creative Collaboration  
  
Running an adventure with *TorchLite* means sharing a lot of authority and creative license with all the players around the table. Especially for GMs and players with experience in other roleplaying games, this can be a big change.  

As the GM, focus on presenting threatening, open-ended challenges. Describe GMC actions with cinematic details that go for the jugular. You do not need to pull punches in *TorchLite*; the rules preserve the players’ ability to keep playing and having fun. They, in turn, will come up with all sorts of imaginative and descriptive ways to address challenges. Run with it—and lead from the front as the GM to encourage your players to do the same. When you incorporate their actions into your descriptions of the challenge, you create a positive feedback loop that makes the ensuing action fun and exciting.  

On the bookkeeping end, you’ll also be keeping track of dwindling challenge die pools. A challenge that’s low on dice may be closer to being resolved, but that doesn’t necessarily make it less intimidating. Challenges with their backs against the wall can lash out with desperate viciousness, pull out the stops, or make a final big push. Also remember that low challenges can roll in player stresses and complications, so low blows are the order of the day. Escalate the action until the dice run out, and then describe the challenge’s defeat.  

During the first session, you may not have a sense that player actions have significant impact on the world beyond their immediate environs. That’s fine; most of your mental bandwidth is focused on getting to know the characters and possibly learning rules. But after each session, you can consider how the players’ actions, character growth choices, and worldbuilding contributions effect the larger setting, and take those into account when planning future adventures and expanding the scope. A few sessions later, you may be surprised to realize in retrospect that the “insignificant” little dungeon they plundered at the beginning was the first domino to set off an epic storyline.  
  
#### Epic Worldbuilding, One Bite at a Time  
  
One of the great joys of fantasy roleplaying is the sense that you’re participating in an epic story where a vast and colorful world witnesses great dangers, astounding heroism, and the sweeping changes of history in motion. This may seem like an intimidating goal for something you do with your buddies in your free time, but *TorchLite* provides some simple tools you can leverage to get there. One of those is already discussed in Epic Characterization, One Bite at a Time under [How Distinctions Evolve](#how-distinctions-evolve).  

If one of your players decides that their character is not just an Elf but a Sea Elf, that implies that Sea Elves are significantly distinctive from other elves. Which means that, if it didn’t already, the game world includes Sea Elves as a separate type of elf. Every time the player characters encounter an elf going forward—or even if you revisit elves they met in earlier sessions—they’ll either be a Sea Elf or a different kind of elf. And that one character, who is now (and probably always was) a Sea Elf, now has a different and more nuanced relationship with all those elves.  

This happens every time a player reframes one of their distinctions, creating ripple effects that can make the world of the game more varied, more nuanced, and more interesting. And it also happens more or less automatically, without requiring anybody to be paying a lot of attention to it.  

That said, the GM should be a part of this process, discussing changes players want to make to their characters, taking note of such changes once they’re finalized, and determining what they might mean for the wider world of which they are a part.  

If one of the players decides that they are a Sea Elf, then the GM can prepare a future adventure where their people’s island home is threatened by elves of a different type. These could be the existing elf types specified in the Peoples section (such as High Elves, Deep Elves, or Wood Elves), or new types, perhaps Snow Elves or Winged Elves or Desert Elves or whatever else might be a cool addition to the world. Playing through that adventure will give the player even more opportunities to refine their sense of what a Sea Elf is and what a Sea Elf is not.  

The real magic happens when you layer multiple such inspirations on top of each other. Another player might shift from Wizard to Court Magician, so now the game has magical politics in play. And a third player combined Ogre and Ranger into Ork Ranger to make room for a new distinction, Noble Blooded. In your next adventure, you can reveal that the Sea Elf’s ancestral isle is threatened by sorcerous Winged Elf aristocrats pushing claims of inheritance from a book of lineages thought lost to history. Everybody’s interests are woven in, and the game starts producing that sense of being in a vibrant and ever-changing world.  

This is an iterative process, each session building on the last, until the GM and players assemble a varied and textured world full of grabby details.  
  
#### Checking for Traps (& stuff)  
  
Adventuring necessitates exploring the unknown and adventurers have to be careful, checking for dangers that may or may not be there. The archetypal example of this is checking for traps. Other examples include spotting ambushes, searching for clues in places where there might not be anything to be found, or generally delving into the setting.  

Any of these exploratory delves can be rolled as a simple test. What a success or failure means, mechanically, depends on if there’s anything there to find.  

If there are traps and the roll succeeds, the character found the trap! Their effect die can be used directly against the trap to start disarming it or be turned into an asset for their forewarning or insight into the mechanism of the trap.  

If there are no traps and the roll succeeds, the character knows there’s no trap. If anyone in the party is carrying **Demoralized** or **Exhausted** stress, the lack of traps is good, refreshing news, and their effect die can be used to recover that stress.  

If there are traps and the roll fails, the character did not find the trap. The GM’s effect die turns into stress: either **Damaged** as their blundered search in fact sets off the trap, or possibly **Demoralized** because, after they say the room is clear and the trap goes off, somebody hurt on their watch.  

If there are no traps and the roll fails, the character isn’t sure that the room is clear. The GM’s effect die can turn into **Demoralized** or **Exhausted** stress as the player deals with the looming dread of pervasive danger and doubtful safety.  

The same basic principle can be applied to searching for ambushes, clues, or even loot. The trick is that a success turns the effect die into something, and a failure results in stress or complication.  
  
##### Check for Communication  
  
If the players don’t check for traps—or any number of other precautions that may seem to the GM like things the characters should have done—it’s usually best to ask if that is an intentional choice. The GM (or anybody else at the table) can simply ask “So you’re walking into the room without checking for traps?” or “Is anyone checking for traps?” This avoids two different issues.  

First off, players halfway into a dungeon may assume that it’s obvious that their characters are proceeding carefully and checking for traps. Sometimes details drop out of narration but not player imaginations. Asking questions gets everybody back on the same page. If a roll is required, players can always roll when prompted.  

On the other hand, players may also be portraying their characters getting reckless or passionate or desperate. In this case, it’s a characterization choice to not check for traps—but it might not be clear to the rest of the table that that’s what’s happening. A quick check-in allows players to enthusiastically concur, “Oh yeah, she’s way past being careful.” And if a roll is required here, they might even get to ***Hinder*** a distinction and earn a Ⓟ for their haste.  
  
#### What Do I Know?  
  
Sometimes players will ask, “which spells do I know?” or “what weapons am I proficient in?” or “which languages can I speak?” There’s a lot of variations on this question, ranging from alchemical recipes (and poisons, and their antidotes) to a paladin’s available medical procedures. Whichever subject prompts the question, the GM has a few options on how to answer it.  
  
##### You Tell Me  
  
One answer is, “I don’t know, what spells or weapon proficiencies or languages do you know?” This answer may sound unhelpful or overly permissive, but it can be a launchpad for player creativity. Players defining what their characters do and do not know not only helps us learn about the character but it also informs the world that produced them.  

Why would a player ever say they don’t know a spell or a weapon proficiency or a language? Well if nothing else they can earn a Ⓟ—make it into a die roll and ***Hinder*** a distinction.  

▶ “I’m a Fire Mage, so this kind of healing isn’t my specialty, but here we go.”  
▶ “I am a Dwarf from a family of smiths, and we all fight with hammers, and this spear is light and bendy and I hate it.”  
▶ “There aren’t a lot of Goblish speakers among the Humans, so I probably don’t understand…”  
It may feel like you need to log all of these instances to define what does and does not fall into each distinction, but you can leave this to squishy memories. That dwarf character doesn’t have to ***Hinder*** every single roll using a spear. Instead, you can chalk it up to complex characters and dynamic circumstances.  
  
##### Create a List in Prep and Downtime  
  
Players and GMs may prefer having an explicit outline of what special knowledges characters have access to. These can be brainstormed during character creation and updated between sessions. New items might be added to reflect developments in the story or training that the character receives.  

Sometimes a player might want to know something that the GM feels is beyond their character’s current capacity. Add these to a different list; they are excellent fuel for adventure goals and rewards.  

This sort of list affords no bonuses or dice, but it does define narrative permission in play. Over the course of multiple adventures, using this tool can facilitate a consistent feel for players and GM alike.  
  
##### Create a List in Play  
  
Or you can hybridize the two solutions above. Whenever the “do I know that” question arises, use game mechanics to answer it. Then add the results to a list on your character sheet.  

In this case you do log your hinders, or at least the interesting ones. You can also add to the list whenever you explain something as a part of your backstory or use an SFX that allows you to add a detail to the game setting.  

Players might create assets for spells, languages, or other special knowledges that they have access to. Those assets are usually useful for just the scene, but that doesn’t mean the character forgets that knowledge afterwards. You can use a list to keep track of the things you’ve established your character knows. It doesn’t give you a die, but it might give you a feeling of satisfaction in a coherent story.  
  
#### Get Into the Zone  
  
Zones introduce positioning and more tactical elements to your game. They bridge between pure “theater of the mind” play and using a grid map.  

Zones abstract out precise positioning of characters and objects but still provide structure, dividing a scene into distinct areas to hang exciting mechanics.  

For example, the GM might create a scene with four distinct zones for an outdoor adventure. The zones are used to designate the general location of characters in the scene, and have a die rating that can be used to interact with it.  
  
##### Dice & Labels  
  
Assigning die ratings to labels is the heart of using zones. The first step is to imagine or sketch out the scene and divide it into two or more areas of varying size. Look for parts of the scene with natural boundaries or transition points that can create possibilities for drama or action. Then write descriptive labels for each and assign a die rating—the larger the rating, the more impact it can have.  

Using our example, the scene might have four obvious zones: the **Rope Bridge**, **Mist-Filled Chasm**, and on either side the **Narrow Trail** and **Rugged Trail**. The chasm looms pretty big within the scene with its d12, while the rope bridge and trail zones on either side have d8 each.  
  
##### Zone Distinctions  
  
Use zones as scene distinctions—they even come with the ***Hinder*** SFX. Any character within the scene can use a zone's distinction.  

Holding off some bad guys on the **Narrow Trail** while your friends escape across the **Rope Bridge** can add its d8 to your pool instead of one of your distinctions. When scuffling with bad guys on the **Rugged Trail**, you could ***Hinder*** the distinction and describe how it’s difficult to keep your footing. **Rope Bridge** can likewise be a help or a hindrance depending on how the character is using it.  
  
##### Zone Complications  
  
Some zones don't contain good things. These are zone complications, from flames to toxic gas to a hail of arrows. Like zone distinctions, a clever character can add a zone complication die against another character.  

The **Mist-Filled Chasm** gets a **Hazard** complication. Getting knocked or thrown into this zone is dangerous and getting taken out may leave you lost in the mists.  
  
##### Zone Traits  
  
Sometimes a zone has a trait that allows it to do something on its own without a character having to act on it. This is neither a complication nor a distinction, so the other characters can’t use the trait directly.  

We can give the **Rope Bridge** a trait called **Sway** rated at d10. The GM can call for a test, rolling **Sway** d10 in the pool, with failure earning a PC an **Off-Balance** or **Queasy** complication.  
  
##### Zone SFX  
  
Spice up zones by giving them SFX. These can let zones interact.  

Let’s give the **Mist-Filled Chasm** a ***Gust of Wind*** SFX that lets the GM spend a Ⓟ or step down the chasm’s Hazard to step up the bridge’s **Sway**. The wind might clear away a little mist, but makes the swaying a formidable d12!  
  
##### Targeting Zones  
  
Zones can be acted upon directly. This may attempt to step down or remove a zone complication or add a new one.  

A character might make a test and target the **Rope Bridge** to create a new Broken Planks zone complication, discouraging pursuit.  
  
##### Movement & Range  
  
Characters can usually move freely anywhere within a zone or move to an adjacent zone on their turn. Some zones can be a barrier or bottleneck, like the **Mist-Filled Chasm** funnelling into the bridge.  

An obstacle within one or more of these zones may make a test necessary to move zones. A particularly large zone might have a complication named something like Great Distance; characters must remove that complication to reach the far side of the zone.  

Similarly, zone borders can inform difficulty in a ranged test. The number of zones determines die size. Within the same zone use d6s, one zone away d8s, two zones d10s, etc. Use two of these dice for test difficulty. In an opposed roll where range is a factor, the GM may add one of these dice to their pool.  
  
### Preparing an Adventure  
  
It’s usually a good idea for GMs to have material prepared before running an adventure. Prepared adventures come in many different forms, formats, and levels of detail. What works best for you is a matter of preference, skill and interest in improvisation, and sheer mental bandwidth.  

While different approaches will be discussed, in the end, GM preparation happens on a continuum. On one end is meticulous, detailed planning that thoroughly details the setting and events and prepares a number of options for the PCs. On the other end is not planning at all and just making it up as you go along, letting the players’ actions be your guide. Most GMs actually end up somewhere in between. What matters most is finding the method that best inspires your creativity while also fitting into the amount of time you have to plan.  
  
#### Ample Prep  
  
The most elaborate preparations provide many things, but central to those offerings are locations and challenges. They also often have a map, because maps are cool. Published adventures usually fall in this first category— whether those adventures are intended for *TorchLite* or whether you are adapting a scenario from another fantasy tabletop RPG.  

At this level of preparation, each location is described,, along with guidelines for how to run one or more scenes there. In many published adventures, there is special narrative text (often formatted with a box around it) that the GM can paraphrase or read aloud to the players to provide a vivid explanation of what their characters perceive. Locations may have scene or zone distinctions to make things interesting and list the challenges that can be confronted there.  

The challenges are presented as complete trait blocks, often with juicy signature assets and SFX, and may include notes for adjusting their difficulties.  

This level of detail is a lot of work—especially for one GM preparing their own scenario for a single playthrough. Luckily, this amount of preparation is not necessary to run a fun game.  
  
#### Playing from a Sketch  
  
GMs who are comfortable doing so can run an adventure on a lot less. A simple map with notes on what can be found where can provide the backbone for an enjoyable adventure. Sketching out challenges ahead of time can let you brainstorm fun signature assets and SFX, but the game will also work just fine with a challenge that is just a die pool with no additional mechanics.  

As mentioned above, GMs can take adventures prepared for other games and use these as a sketch, adding *TorchLite* mechanics as they go. You can take any encounter title, add a pool of dice to it for a challenge pool, and then append a die rating to key descriptive words in its description: now you’ve got a challenge with interactive elements.  
  
#### Improvise  
  
Some experienced GMs can run adventures without any preparation at all, relying entirely on a well-developed sense of pacing and challenge. Locations are improvised as the players go, with challenges made up on the spot by throwing together a die pool and an appropriate SFX or two.  

There’s a lot of advantages to this approach, especially since it can end that climactic showdown just as your available time is coming to a close. It is, however, a complex balancing act that should not be undertaken by GMs who aren’t well-versed in running *TorchLite* adventures.  
  
### Adventure Blocks  
  
The pieces of a prepared *TorchLite* adventure—challenges, tests, locations, and scenes—can all be thought of as blocks that you stack together to build your adventure. Any prepared adventure can be broken down into its constituent blocks, which can then be swapped out, tinkered with, or plundered for reuse in some other adventure. They’re super useful like that.  

Some blocks are simple, some are complex. Some blocks are made out of other blocks.  

*TorchLite* presents these blocks in a compact format that makes them easy to mix and match. Here’s what you can expect to find in each, allowing with some examples:  
  
#### Challenge Blocks  
  
These chunks of traits and dice are often the pillars of your adventure. The challenge block presents all the information that you will need to run the challenge, precluding page-flipping and reference-hunting. If you’re printing out your challenges, leave space for complications, assets, and Ⓟs.  

A description of the challenge written to be read aloud can greatly simplify the GM task of presenting the challenge in an engaging way.  

A challenge is made of:  

▶ a description  
▶ traits  
▶ possibly SFX  
  
##### Jabberwocky  
  
This horrific abomination may have once been a bear, but perverse magic has twisted it into a hulking nightmare monstrosity the size of a cottage. It has too many arms, all of which end in claws. Its eyes and mouth glow with an eldritch green light, as do any wounds that bleed.  

Twisted Abomination (Boss) d10 d10 d10  

Drive: Devour Prey d10  

Drive: Destroy Threats d8  

Jaws that Bite d12  

Claws that Catch d8  

Eyes of Flame d12  

***All-Out Attack:*** Spend a Ⓟ to target multiple opponents when you roll to inflict **Damaged**. For each additional target, add a d6 and keep an extra effect die.  
  
#### Location Blocks  
  
The exciting sets and locales of your adventure are described by location blocks. Elements of backstory and setting can be embedded in locations, which brings those elements up close and personal for the players. While not every location will end up hosting an action sequence, preparing for that eternal possibility is not a bad idea.  

In the location description, try to highlight at least three senses—scent, taste, touch, even balance, in addition to sight and sound—to ground your players in a sense of place. A location description written to be read aloud can greatly simplify the GM task of setting the scene.  

A location includes:  

▶ a description  
▶ one or more zones (which might have traits or SFX)  
▶ potential assets that players might create  
  
##### Tulgey Wood  
  
Shadowy woodland spreads out before you, tangled with with gnarled trucks and thick undergrowth. Distant birdsong and the constant creaking of boughs in the wind are interrupted only occasionally by the rustle of some unseen, foraging animal. The air is cloying with humidity, and the rich smell of leaves mulching into soil is pervasive. Under the canopy of dark leaves, it’s hard to follow the thin dirt road that winds through the trees.  

The Wood stretches for leagues in either direction. A number of trails fork off of the road and are often difficult to distinguish from the main road. Most lead to stagnant ponds, long-abandoned homesteads, or dissipate into dead ends.  
  
###### Zones  
  
Thin Dirt Road d8  

***This Isn’t the Road:*** when you discover you’ve followed a useless fork in the road, gain **Demoralized**  d6 and a Ⓟ.  

Shadows and Brambles d8  

High Among the Creaking Boughs d8  

***Death from Above:*** when you attack a target on the ground, step up your effect die.  
  
###### Potential Assets  
  
Hunting Blind, Bandersnatch Larvae (good eating!), Curious Mushrooms, Jubjub Plumage (prized as emblems of bravery), Treetop Vantage  
  
#### Scene Blocks  
  
A scene block is mostly made up of other blocks. This preparation itemizes all the resources that you expect to use when running the scene. You can format a scene in two different ways.  

The simplest format refers to all the other blocks, which appear elsewhere. This format presents the scene as a list of blocks. When you start the scene, run down the list to make sure you have the other blocks handy. An example of this format is below.  

The second format includes all the other blocks in the scene block. This can be very handy at the table, but often requires that some blocks appear multiple times in an adventure. Examples of this format can be found in the sample adventure [Murmurs in the Mire](#murmurs-in-the-mire).  

A scene includes:  

▶ a description  
▶ one or more locations in which it takes place  
▶ a challenge or tests to confront  
▶ possibly a scene distinction  
Players can confound your scene expectations, but in most instances you can use most of the same blocks. You only need a little spin to reflect the players’ unexpected agenda.  

For instance, if the players decide to cleanse the cursed Jabberwocky instead of hunt it, they’ll still need to track it down in the Tulgey Wood, and you can run the cleansing as an action sequence with the beast resisting or disrupting the cleansing ritual.  

Hunting the Jabberwocky  

When the players return to Tulgey Wood, they do so as hunters, tracking down the Jabberwocky. Give the players some time to prepare, get the lay of the land, and discuss their strategy. Run the bulk of the hunt as an action sequence. Keep the action moving, ranging all over the wood.  
  
##### Location  
  
Use Tulgey Wood. The Jabberwocky will not leave the wood, but players may need to escape the location if things go south.  
  
##### Challenges and Tests  
  
Use tests to make preparations (create assets) and to track down the beast (an asset on success, an ambush by the Jabberwocky on failure).  

Use the Jabberwocky as the single challenge in an action sequence. When the Jabberwocky’s boss trait is depleted, it is captured, slain, or pacified.  
  
##### Scene Distinction  
  
On the Hunt! d8  

***Teamwork Makes the Dream Work:*** when you use an asset created by another player, double it for any roll and step it down afterwards.  

Test Blocks  

It may seem superfluous to prepare tests, but the benefit is not just gathering all the bits of information you need (which is still handy). brainstorming the things players might do expands your sense of possibilities. Sometimes that leads you to add elements to other parts of the adventure, increasing depth and detail.  

A test is simple:  

▶ a description  
▶ a difficulty  
▶ possibly an asset cap  
▶ possibly a way to organize multiple tests  
Crossing Tulgey Wood  

Players may cross the wood with a series of tests. Ask who is leading the way. Direct every other player to make a roll to assist (or cause trouble); successes create assets for the lead player while failures create complications. Anyone riding in a wagon may make a recovery roll instead of a travel roll.  

The lead player can then make a capstone roll for the crossing. The players reach their destination no matter the result; failure inflicts **Exhausted** stress on everyone who rolled.  

Roll d8 d8 for all difficulties.  
  
#### Zone Blocks  
  
You can think of [zones](#zones) as blocks, too, especially since they can be swapped out or harvested for other adventures very easily.  
  
### The Five Scene Adventure  
  
A five scene adventure is a prepared adventure format composed of five prepared scenes designed to tell a complete story. This adventure structure is as old as tabletop RPGs, and has been codified by Johnn Four as the [Five Room Dungeon methodology](https://www.roleplayingtips.com). What follows is a riff on this classic structure, optimized for *TorchLite*.  

These are the five scenes you will prepare ahead of time:  

▶ The Portcullis  
▶ The Exploration  
▶ The Catch  
▶ The Boss  
▶ The Loot  

Collectively, the five prepared scenes vary the spotlight between the player characters and provide the outline of an adventurous tale. Actual play through will include additional scenes as you transition and respond to player interest and side treks. Laid out here are the elements you can prepare for.  

There is an example Five Scene Adventure: [Murmurs in the Mire](#murmurs-in-the-mire).  
  
#### The Premise  
  
Before you begin play, the premise is a short bit of exposition where the GM establishes expectations:  

You are about to attempt daring heist to steal a priceless artifact that each of you has their own reasons for wanting.  

The twin moons will only align once this century. Cultists gather to complete a perverse sacrifice; can you stop them?  

Success or failure will be measured against the expectations of the premise. Engage in some light foreshadowing of things that may unfold. The quality of a plot twist will owe its seeds to the buy-in created here before the adventure proper even begins.  

While the Premise is presented first in a prepared adventure, it’s often written last. It’s a lot easier to make promises if you already know what’s in the rest of the adventure!  

Importantly, the Premise is not a scene. There are no significant choices to make at this stage, so don’t give the players the impression that there are. Answer all of their questions with short answers: either give away information that they could plausibly get their hands on from outside of the adventure (such as asking around town before entering its haunted mine) or tell them that the information they seek is simply not available until the adventure starts. It is strongly recommended that you completely avoid rolling dice during the premise: that’s for the adventure.  

The premise is also a great opportunity to take care of a couple little tasks that need doing at the top of every game.  

Go around the table and have the players give their character name, pronouns, and distinctions. In the first session this is a compact introduction; in later sessions it can be a useful reminder of what to expect from each character.  

Next review, and adjust if necessary, the session and character milestones. These are the initial promises of what lies ahead. They’ll directly translate as a measure of success when XP is tabulated.  

Now cut to the action. Don’t waddle around in a tavern all session. Adventure lies ahead!  
  
#### The Portcullis  
  
A warded entrance, a deep jungle trek, a giant spider: any of these can serve as an obstacle.  

Something, someone, or some monster has blocked regular folk from getting at the rest of the adventure. Only our adventurers can crack the seal and get at the excitement inside.  

The portcullis is what marks this as an adventure. This is where the roleplaying really begins. Start with assumptions of a gathered party facing a common threat. The goal here is to spotlight the characters and establish them as the main cast. Let them show off as they lay waste to the entrance guardian or cleverly bypass the traps which have thwarted the others.  

Aim to have everyone roll some dice at least once in this scene. By the time you make it around the table everyone will have had an opportunity to learn or refresh themselves on how the game works.  

A challenge or mob fight allows the player’s to show their character’s abilities and feel competent. The challenge or mob used should be relatively simple: fewer SFX and signature assets compared to the Boss. This keeps the mechanical spotlight and game rules (re-)introduction focused on the players.  
  
#### The Exploration  
  
Mysterious locations are a core element of *TorchLite* gameplay. This scene’s goal is twofold: first, it provides more information about the site’s context, history, and significance. The challenges the players overcome leak details that give them an idea of where they are and what they’re up against. Secondly, the Exploration gives players opportunities to showcase their characters outside the action of combat.  

The party may split into concurrent explorations here, gathering details and resources in different locations. These smaller explorations are still considered part of the same major scene even if their characters are in separate locations. They can then come back together to establish key discoveries and plot points or face a puzzle spotlighting the adventure.  

Asset creation is the typical mechanical spotlight in the exploration scene. Survey the reveal SFX that the players have available and provide opportunities for them to be called upon. Alternately, you can provide a reveal SFX on the scene distinction. If there is combat to be had in this scene, it is best resolved with simple tests against minor monsters or GMCs.  
  
#### The Catch  
  
The captured villain is only a lackey, the guiding diary has been stolen, or all the villagers along the way have been turned to stone: every engaging story has a low point for the character’s morale. In *TorchLite*, this is the point where the players must find a way forward through adversity. If they are doing well, it is an unpredictable surprise that threatens to derail their success; if things have gone poorly, it is a situation that gets worse as a result of their past failures.  

This scene is built in two parts: a monkeywrench and a setback. The monkeywrench is a twist, reveal, or plot development that can complicate the PCs’ plan. The setback is made up of consequences and difficulties that the PCs will have to push through to continue.  
  
#### The Monkeywrench  
  
The monkeywrench can be a sudden betrayal from a trusted ally, the revelation of a hidden agenda, or the temptation of a distracting side quest. It should create a moment of shock and uncertainty for the players. The secret door grinds open and the tell-tale stench of undeath—there weren’t supposed to be zombie in here!—emanates from within.  
  
#### ...and the Setback  
  
The setback, on the other hand, is a direct roadblock or confrontation with the impact on the world. These can include physical barriers, emotional turmoil, or moral dilemmas. The purpose of the setback is to test the resilience and determination of the characters, pushing them to their limits and forcing them to make difficult choices. Establish a challenge pool and measure the impact of those decisions.  

The trick is that while the monkey-wrench is optional, the setback is not. Sometimes the players will provide their own monkeywrench, either because they made some… questionable choices, or because their dice betrayed them. If the PCs fail horribly in an early scene, you can catch them with the setback. It’s a dire consequence that you have ready to go.  

If the players have breezed through everything so far and haven’t made any spectacular blunders, you can still use the setback by employing the monkeywrench. Because the monkeywrench is some element that the heroes could not have foreseen or some nefarious action taken by the big bad, the fallout of the setback isn’t the players’ fault… but they still have to deal with it.  

Use the Catch to spotlight a character the other scenes won’t, or for an extra dose of the table’s main play preference. Give them another clash if their blades are thirsting, a library research scramble for the plotters and thinkers, or a reveal scene that the big bad is one of the heroes’ former lovers.  
  
#### The Boss  
  
Facing the dragon in her lair, the mummy in his tomb, or the corrupt mayor at city hall, the boss scene is the high point confrontation of the adventure.  

Lay out the scene. Lavish on the details. “Yes and …” the players as they ask clarifying questions. This is the finale. Put it all on the table.  

While this scene obviously calls for a boss (built with signature assets and SFX, with more and/or larger dice than the portcullis), always add at least one and maybe even two other challenges: a mob of lackeys, an unfolding crisis, or the challenge that the heroes are here to stop and the boss is merely in their way. Mobs and other challenge pools act each round, but once the boss is defeated the scene draws to a close. Any remaining threats flee or fall.  

Frame the scene dynamically: move cinematically through multiple rooms or zones, bob and weave the confrontation around large support columns, or split the party into two concurrent scenes, both of which require success. Keep the tempo and pressure up.  
  
#### The Loot  
  
A pile of coins, the map to the Lost Halls, or the final ingredient to cure the prince, the loot is about staking out a flashy victory. The bards will entice you with their tales, using the loot to tease you, “Do you know the one about the Blade of Dandelyn?” The loot is about bringing together the whole tale and creating a memorable moment.  

The Loot is where the GM and players resolve the questions and promises posed back in the premise of the adventure. Who was the real villain? What is in the Dragon’s hoard? Is the harvest saved?  

This type of scene is often called a tag scene. It's an explicit closing and falling action after the final conflict. It is a specific call out to tie things up and establish closing narratives. Not all tables, and not all sessions running short on time, will resolve this with many, or even any, die rolls. Read the room and the clock to find what works best for your game.  

Beyond the story wrap up, bookkeeping review for milestones, wealth improvement, and XP expenditure happen here. You might incorporate these elements into your tag scenes or make these changes “off camera.”  
  
## Murmurs in the Mire  
  
This Five Scene Adventure is designed to fit well into any setting or campaign, and to work especially well as a one-shot or as a first session.  
  
### The Premise: Keep on the Moulderlands  
  
Read or paraphrase the following to the players, or establish these facts during a short opening scene:  

▶ Mirewatch is a remote port and trading village on the edge of a dense fungal swamp known as the Moulderlands. A garrison of soldiers led by Castellan Bellairs, sent here to keep an eye out for threats, protects the village from the watchtower of a ruined keep they’ve named Fort Heeding.  
▶ The PCs have been given a missive to deliver to the Castellan’s hand—and no other. (Who has tasked them with this delivery is up to the table, and isn’t particularly relevant to this adventure.)  
***Provide the players with the following milestone for the length of this adventure:***  
  
#### Session Milestone: Under Mirewatch  
  
▶ 1 XP when you first enter a new underground area.  
▶ 3 XP when you find a hidden object or learn more about the ancient history of the region.  
▶ 10 XP when you discover the force driving the undead and then either free the Castellan or retreat back to the surface without her.  
  
### The Portcullis: The Hamlet of Elemental Weevils  
  
Read or paraphrase the following:  

*You can see trails of smoke—black and sooty, not clean and white—as you approach the town of Mirewatch. When the town’s wooden palisade comes into view, you can see that it is breached in a handful of places. Once through the gates, the extent of the carnage becomes clear. Scattered clumps of shattered wood and roof thatching are scattered across the main road. Livestock and a few unfortunate mortals lie dead in mud. A few armored skeletons, battered and smashed, lie beside them. The struts of the palisade and many of the buildings seem to be infested with cat-sized parasites, chewing things apart. Trails of smoke rise into the sky from still-smoldering fires. Mirewatch was attacked by the undead last night, and the town is struggling to recover. What do you do?*  

Nobody in town is keen on answering questions right now; they’re all intent on putting out fires, finding lost children, and patching up both walls and neighbours. Our heroes can help townsfolk recover, heal, or shore up defenses. Treat each of these as a test with a difficulty of d8 d8.  

With every success, they get a new piece of the story, as delivered by the people they help:  

▶ The Moulderlands used to be plagued by regular waves of undead that rose up every decade or so, out of an ancient graveyard. Two years ago, the Castellan had her soldiers seal up the various crypts and mausoleums an ancient empire left behind. No more undead were seen for many years—until last night.  
▶ One of the soldiers from Fort Heeding reports that last night the undead came pouring out of a previously undiscovered secret passage at the base of the watchtower. Caught flat footed, the garrison was slaughtered. He barely survived to stagger into the town at dawn.  
▶ The undead captured the Castellan and a trio of her lieutenants, retreating back into the tunnels before anyone else realized what had happened.  
▶ The remaining people of Mirewatch aren’t soldiers or adventurers. They’re crafters, fishers, lumberjacks, homemakers, and dockworkers. And now they are unprotected. There is no one to venture into the revealed passage and try to rescue Castellan Bellairs and her officers… except the player characters.  
▶ (Reveal this one last) The small council of merchants who lead the town call upon the PCs to go after the Castellan and offer a persuasive reward.  
When the players have heard all the points of information listed above, ask them what they do next.  

If the player characters head out on a rescue or investigation mission, the exposed entrance to the tunnels under the watchtower is the obvious place to start. Transition to the Tomb of Borers scene. Still reeling from the attack, the town cannot offer any material support.  

If the players investigate elsewhere —such as looking into the ancient cemetery or getting the lay of the land in general—provide or improvise short answers without calling for die rolls. The meat of the adventure is down the tunnels.  

If the PCs remain in town, the undead will raid again the next night, attacking a local shrine and taking the last soldier they left behind, as well the local clergy caring for him. After that, they will keep raiding every night until they are stopped or all the townsfolk are gone. They attack in overwhelming numbers; give each PC a d12 d12 difficulty test to escape; on failure, they are dragged into the Curse of Kraad scene.  
  
### The Exploration: Tomb of Borers  
  
Read or paraphrase the following:  

*Fort Heeding was once a much larger fortification, but today only one of its wings and its watchtower are standing properly, recently renovated. The rest are tumbled ruins, overgrown with swamp grass. The entrance to the tunnels is easy to find: a river of shambling tracks lead back to a gaping hole in the inner curtain wall. Within you find a labyrinth of twisting tunnels and the distant sounds of digging echoing up from the depths. What do you do?*  

Players may want to prepare for spelunking by fashioning torches or scavenging the watchtower for ropes or mapping supplies. Treat each of these attempts as a difficulty d6 d6 test to create an asset.  

As before, if the players want to investigate the tower or ruins, give them simple, forthright answers without tests. The old castle is in tumbled ruins; the interior of the watchtower is, too, but more recently. All the real action is underground.  

Once the players head downwards, describe twisting tunnels snaking eastward (towards the ancient cemetery). Eventually the tunnels feature excavated and pried-open coffins and occasionally open onto a subterranean mausoleum, each grave exhumed and desecrated. That’s about when they stumble across the animated skeletons and the overfed grave worms.  

In this scene, the PCs confront two challenge pools: the Undead Diggers and the Tide of Carrion Worms. The GM can present them both at once in one grand running melee or intersperse tunnel exploration with encounters alternating between the two.  
  
#### Tide of Carrion Worms  
  
*Imported from lands afar, they’ve overgrown on the feast of the necropolis below and have become less picky about whether their food is wriggling or rotting.*  

**Mob Dice:** d6 d6 d6 d6 d6  

**Drive: Longing For Home Soil** d8  
**Drive: Insatiable Appetite** d8  

***All-Out Attack:*** Spend a Ⓟ to target multiple opponents when you roll to inflict **Damaged**. For each additional target, add a d6 and keep an extra effect die.  

***Tunneler:*** Spend a plot point to burrow a child size tunnel.  

***Swarm Assault:*** Take **Enthralled** d6 to double your Drive die and keep an additional die for total when overwhelming a single enemy.  

As the scene progresses (or after the dust settles entirely), drop these little tidbits of information:  

▶ A number of tunnels arc upwards towards the cemetery but have been collapsed; similarly, whenever a tunnel breaches an underground mausoleum, that mausoleum’s entrance to the surface has been bricked over.  
▶ Other tunnels seem to curl and probe through the earth; it is as if the diggers were searching for a way out.  
▶ The undead diggers are exhuming corpses to raise as new skeletons and zombies.  
▶ Remains from graves bearing a heraldic crest of a dragon impaled on a sword are not immediately reanimated, but dragged deeper into the labyrinth.  
Players may also try to discern the nature, source, or motivation of the undead; this is a d8 d8 difficulty test; success reveals the following:  

▶ The undead are cursed to rise each blood moon to find and kill the living and raise the dead to swell their own numbers.  
▶ (Effect die of d10 or larger, or subsequent success) The curse is sloppy and hastily laid; clever spellwork could subvert or remove it entirely. However, that would take the PCs days of research and is outside the scope of this adventure.  
Once the Diggers and Worms are dealt with, the players can easily find their way into Thalos Kraad’s sepulcher-sanctum for the Curse of Kraad scene. Player characters who fall in this scene are dragged away by the Undead Diggers… into the sepulcher-sanctum, for the Curse of Kraad scene.  
  
#### Undead Diggers  
  
*Pulled by two masters, the skeletons dig ceaselessly hunting bodies or escape.*  

**Mob Dice:** d6 d6 d6  

**Drive: Serve the Curse that Animated You** d8  
**Drive: Serve the Scales that Guide You** d8  

**Shovels and Blades** d8  
**Robed Ghasts** d10  

***Death-Swollen ranks:*** when the dead uncover a new body, the ghasts among their number reanimate the corpse to join them. Step down the asset **Robed Ghasts** to add a d8 to Undead Diggers’ challenge pool.  

***All-Out Attack:*** Spend a Ⓟ to target multiple opponents when you roll to inflict **Damaged**. For each additional target, add a d6 and keep an extra effect die.  

***Fleshless:*** When a roll would inflict **Exhausted** stress on you, or stress or complications from poison or piercing weapons, step down that roll’s effect die against you. You can also spend a Ⓟ to ignore the stress entirely.  

***Brittle Bones:*** When a roll to inflict **Damaged** on you with blunt force or bludgeoning weapons succeeds, earn a PP and step up that roll’s effect die against you.  
  
### The Catch: The Curse of Kraad  
  
Read or paraphrase the following, and then one of the subsequent boxes:  

*The tunnels turn back westward and breach a massive chamber lined with elaborate stonework. Captured will-o-wisps drift along the arched ceiling, lighting the room in an ethereal glow. The room is filled with rank upon rank of stone work tables—no, sarcophagi converted into work surfaces. Funereal urns, grave goods, and desiccated bodies lie scattered across these tables. All the remains are emblazoned somewhere with the crest of the sword-impaled dragon.*  

If the player characters gained entry here on their own power, read or paraphrase this:  

*In the corner curls a gaunt figure, clad in tattered vestments that must have once been regal, before the rot got to them. As you approach, he cringes back against the stones, as if he could push his way though them to escape. “Don’t come any closer,” he rasps, then shakes his head. “No. Wait. Do come closer. Be quick. Help me. Please. You’ve got to kill me!”*  

If the player characters were dragged here, direct them to step down all their stresses and then read or paraphrase this:  

*You take all this in blearily as you come to. Clammy hands pat your cheek gently. “There now,” says a voice. “All fixed up. Or at least, fixed up enough to do what’s necessary.” A gaunt, pale face floats into your vision, attached to a body in tattered vestments that must have once been regal. “Now,” your rescuer says, “Please kill me.”*  

The figure is Anton Kraad the First; he reeks of grave rot, wears a decayed tabard bearing the sword-impaled dragon crest, and has recently been reanimated as vampire spawn. Struggling with his overwhelming thirst for blood, he alternates between begging for the player characters to put him out of his misery before his humanity drains away… and lashing out to disable and feast upon their hot blood.  

Anton is a reluctant challenge pool: at times, he may not want to be actively hostile. Other times he may lash out as his hunger overwhelms him. He (and his blood curse) are a lingering threat until his challenge pool is reduced to zero dice—but that does not necessarily require violence or his death in combat.  

On their turn, players can try to convince him to accept restraints, or even submit to a clerical cleansing ritual. All of these are actions that reduce his challenge pool. So too is forcibly subduing him so they can deliver a merciful deathblow.  

On his own turn, Anton might lash out physically, volubly despair at the inevitability of his damnation (inflicting **Demoralized** stress on the players), attempt to flee, or develop a pitiable demeanor (if successful, his effect die adds to his challenge pool). This need not be a knock-down drag-out fight… but it also can be if the players choose to make it so.

Over the course of the scene (or after Anton has been defeated, in a dying soliloquoy), reveal the following:  

Anton Kraad ruled these lands centuries ago as a benevolent sorcerer-king. When his lands and people were preyed upon by the seemingly invincible dragon Murmurant, he turned to necromancy to defeat her.  

▶ His victory did not come without a cost: his children, his children’s children, and his whole dynasty after him, fell into the infernal depths of necromancy and became horrific tyrants. They conquered neighbours, oppressed their subjects, and turned his good name into a curse.  
▶ Eventually the Kraad dynasty pushed too far and an alliance of their neighbours rose up to purge the Kraads from the land. They almost succeeded.  
▶ Thalos Kraad, the last of the Kraad line, made his final stand here, in the now-destroyed keep. Knowing the end was near, Thalos dug a secret tunnel to the necropolis a short distance away and escaped, casting a vengeful spell that animated the buried warriors and filled them with a hateful need to destroy the living.  
▶ Warriors were raised as skeletons and zombies; clerics of the Kraad death cult became robed ghasts; but a special role awaited the members of the Kraad dynasty: they would be raised as vampires to lead the undead army. Anton has been raised as such; presently he is merely vampire spawn, but once he drinks mortal blood, his humanity will boil away and he will become a vampire bound to the same infernal curse.  
▶ “Murmurant had the last laugh in the end,” he cries with his final breath. “She broods beneath us, she has turned Thalos’ curse to her own ends…”  

If the players were dragged here and wonder why they weren’t just killed, Anton explains:  

▶ The party is bearing a Kraad artifact—he can sense it, just as the undead can, and he points it out (and maybe takes a hungry swipe)—inside the missive intended for the Castellan.  

Once Anton is dealt with, the players might search through the Kraad artifacts piled up in the sepulcher. Among them is the journal of Thalos Kraad himself, detailing his rule, his experiments, and his final lingering curse. He also outlined his plans to escape to a distant shore and become a lich.  

Players searching for riches or useful gear may roll for a test-created asset at difficulty d10 d10 to find something that isn’t cursed by its original Kraad owner. On any failure, they gain the complication **Devious Curse**.  

Now the players know that the undead are being directed by Murmurant, deeper in the labyrinth. If the player characters were brought into this scene directly from The Hamlet of Elemental Weevils, proceed to the Temple of Borers scene to find the dragon’s lair. Otherwise, proceed directly to The Dead Hand of Gloom.  
  
### The Boss: The Dead Hand of Gloom  
  
Read or paraphrase the following:  

*You scour through the labyrinth until all that is left is a tunnel that ends where its floor collapsed into a deeper chamber. Scaling down the walls is difficult, but when you reach the bottom, you find yourself in a water-carved cavern around yet another mausoleum, this one buried deeper than all the rest. One of its walls has tumbled out into the cavern, and within you see a glittering yet insubstantial serpentine form. Behind that are four crude cages hanging from the ceiling, each containing a slumped mortal figure. But the shimmering figure raises its head, spreads its wings, and the ghost dragon Murmurant advances upon you, screeching, “More minions of Thalos Kraad?!”*  

This scene confronts the players with a boss challenge pool: Murmurant, the Faded. The spectral dragon is obsessed with seeking her vengeance and assumes any mortal from the surface is a Kraad subject, including the Castellan, her lieutenants, and the player characters.  

She also likes to talk. Punctuate every roll she makes with exposition, such as:  

▶ “What kind person becomes a willing minion of the Kraads? You bend your will to their evil intents!”  
▶ “The Kraads are a curse upon this land, look how they desecrate even their own dead!”  
▶ “Great and terrible sorcerers, they claim to be. Pah! I unwound Thalos Kraad’s little curse in days, and seized control of his pathetic little shambling army.”  
▶ “The mortals came to my swamp, I took their cattle as tribute, and we lived in peace for centuries, and then Anton Kraad said No more! All these lands were the domain of his family, his dynasty, his petty little kingdom!”  

Players can address the challenge pool with violence: the standard operating procedure of hacking and slashing and fireballing. But they may also attempt to talk down the vengeful ghost, convincing her that the Kraads no longer rule above, that she’s abducted the wrong people, and that Thalos Kraad has already escaped. Presenting Thalos Kraad’s journal can especially help in this effort (if it’s not already an asset, a plot point can turn it into a d8).  

Players can also mix and match approaches. Murmurant is attacking them with overwhelming violence, and responding in kind in defense is an understandable response and does not really hamper their rhetorical position.  

Whether the players attack or talk to the dragon, all such actions still whittle down her challenge pool.  

Players may also attempt to free the Castellan and her lieutenants. Murmurant will oppose that action, so she rolls the difficulty. Success does not reduce her challenge pool, but creates an asset equal to the player’s effect die, representing these allies joining the fight.  

The players may also choose to cut and run, with or without the prisoners being freed. Murmurant’s mausoleum does have a staircase leading up to the surface. Murmurant rolls the difficulty for escape tests, as well; each successful test gets one player character to the stairs. Once up in the tight confines of the staircase, the spectral dragon cannot follow. The surface entrance is bricked over, but even weary adventurers can get through a brick wall.

***All-Out Attack:*** Spend a Ⓟ to target multiple opponents when you roll to inflict **Damaged**. For each additional target, add a d6 and keep an extra effect die.  

***At Home in the Mire:*** Spend a plot point to gain the asset **Amphibious** d8. While you have this asset, you are unrestricted in swampy terrain.  

***Draining Presence:*** When you succeed on a roll to inflict stress or a complication, spend a plot point to inflict d8 **Demoralized** stress on the same foe.

***Legendary Resistance:*** Step down **Resilience** in lieu of spending a plot point or to ignore an incoming complication or stress. Recover **Resilience** at the beginning of a new scene  

### The Loot: Against the Tyrants  

This final scene plays out differently depending on what the players have done throughout the adventure.  

If Murmurant is slain or subdued, the undead army collapses into inert corpses. They will rise again at the next blood moon unless a purifying ritual is performed, but there is no rush and the town cleric can handle the rites if the player characters cannot. The labyrinth of tunnels is clear (aside from the rogue carrion worm) and can be investigated, plundered, or burned until it collapses.  

If the players escaped with Murmurant still active and ranting, the undead army will attack the following night. If the players plan a defense, warn them that they will be testing against a d12 d12 difficulty. Otherwise they may try to evacuate the town or simply make their own escape.  

If the players rescued the Castellan, the town merchants happily turn over their promised reward. If an attack is imminent, she will organize an evacuation herself; if the undead army has collapsed, she will escort the town cleric down to purify the curse in a few days and then lead her surviving soldiers to collapse the tunnels. The Castellan can also fill in any exposition the players are unclear on: she’s been sitting there while Murmurant ranted at her for almost a full day, after all.  

If the players deliver the missive to the Castellan’s hand, she opens it to reveal a Kraad artifact and a letter recommending the PCs for a dangerous assignment (ie, the next adventure).  

Any loot the players have created as assets are valid candidates to be turned into signature assets by spending XP.  
  
### Additional Details for the GM  
  
The empire that once ruled these lands was led by a royal family of necromancer-kings who preyed on neighboring nations. Their enemies allied to destroy them, and the last scion of the ruling house—a powerful spellcaster called Thalos Kraad—made his final stand in the now-destroyed keep. Knowing the end was near, Kraad dug a secret tunnel to the necropolis a short distance away and escaped, casting a vengeful spell that animated the buried warriors and filled them with a hateful need to destroy the living. The necromancer fled to far off lands and became a lich, but his villainous plans are another tale. The undead that Kraad left behind lay dormant for years at a time, but every blood moon they rise again to form an army and make war upon any mortals they can find.  

The last time they arose, however, the skeletons and other walking dead found no way out of the crypts and catacombs in which they were interred, since the Castellan and her soldiers had sealed them up and buried them. So they began exploring and digging, looking for an exit. Their excavations unearthed the resting place of Murmurant, a dragon slain by the necromancer-kings in the course of building their empire. The army raised Murmurant’s ghost to add to their numbers, but then the mindless undead fell under the sway of the spectral dragon.  

Murmurant wants revenge. She seeks the descendants of those who murdered her, but she knows nothing of the empire’s fall or other surface events in the many centuries since her demise. After she found and unlocked the secret passage, the ghostly dragon sent her undead soldiers to capture local leaders to interrogate. The skeletons took the Castellan and her officers back to Murmurant, who has tried to extract answers to her questions. The prisoners know nothing of the fallen empire, but the spectral dragon dismisses their protestations of ignorance as lies. Believing they are servants of the necromancer-kings trying to protect their masters, Murmurant intends to lock the captives away until they reveal the truth, and to keep raiding the village for more potential informants.  

Ironically, the answers Murmurant seeks are within the catacombs. A journal Thalos Kraad carelessly abandoned in his rush to escape details his plans to travel to a far-off wilderness and cheat death by becoming a lich. Murmurant could use that information to track down this last of the necromancer-kings and seek her revenge—if she knew it existed. The PCs may need to defeat or avoid the ghost dragon to rescue the prisoners, but if they recover the journal, it can also be a precious bargaining chip to negotiate with.  
  
#### More About Mirewatch  
  
Clinging to life on a rocky peninsula at the edge of the Moulderlands’ swampy forests and surrounded by danger and wilderness on all sides, Mirewatch can be a great base for ongoing adventures. Here is some extra background on this village and trading post in case your PCs spend more time there.  

The village grew out of the partially demolished keep and watchtower now known as Fort Heeding, built by some lost empire that once ruled this region. In addition to the ancient cemetery nearby periodically unleashing hordes of warlike undead, various pirate crews, marauding creatures, and bands of brigands use the marshy woods of the Moulderlands as a hideout after raiding distant shores. To keep an eye on these threats, the respected halfling mercenary captain Yasmin Bellairs was appointed as Castellan to garrison Fort Heeding, leading a dozen soldiers to this desolate frontier.  

The Callestan erected docks, created a defensive wooden palisade around the whole area, sealed up the neighboring crypts and mausoleums to prevent further undead incursions, and then shored up and repaired the once-crumbling watchtower. Hoping to one day rebuild the whole keep, she began sending lumber and other resources back by ship to trade for other supplies. These businesses grew, and more laborers were recruited, both from across the water and from local families of dwarves and goblins dwelling beneath the hills to the south. Also, a handful of scholars arrived to study the cemetery and other neighboring ruins. In less than twenty years, this community became a small hamlet, and now at least 60 souls call Mirewatch home.  

#### Ideas for Future Adventures  

The PCs may want to retrace Thalos Kraaad’s escape to return his grimoire, find a way to break his curse, or slay him in hopes that ends it.  

Having proven their worth the Town Council needs a capable escort aboard the Lady Demeter as she ferries a special cargo out of port.  

Deliver news of the events and convince the local lord to send a new Castellan and retinue to protect the Mirelands.  
  
## Exploring Beyond the TorchLite  
  
The best part about *TorchLite* is that you can add to it, extend it, patch it, twist it, and mold it into whatever shape you and your table like most. Here’s a number of options for modifying *TorchLite* to suit your tastes.  
  
### The Bane Pool  
  
The bane pool is an optional rule for the GM that replaces difficulty dice and the GM’s pool of Plot Points. Instead, the GM maintains a special, ongoing pool of dice that works a bit like a challenge pool, but representing the overall ebb and flow of trouble and danger across the entire adventure. Usually, when a player rolls a test, the GM rolls the bane pool to oppose.  

At the opening of a new adventure, the GM establishes the bane pool as a matched pair of two dice. It usually starts each session at d6 d6, but it can be d8 d8 or higher depending on the stakes of the story.  

Whenever a player roll a hitch, if the GM wants to take advantage of it, the GM gives that player a Ⓟ, then adds d6 to the bane pool. If the player rolled multiple hitches, the GM can step up the new d6 bane die once for each additional hitch beyond the first (d8 for two hitches, d10 for three hitches, or d12 for four). When the GM adds a bane die, they may also describe something that has happened in the scene to make life more complicated for one or more player characters.  

Whenever the GM would add a new die to the bane pool, they can instead choose to step up an existing bane die.  

In this variant rule, the GM doesn’t track their own pool of Plot Points. Rather, the GM can spend bane dice like plot points, obtaining the same benefits for their GMCs that a player gets for spending Ⓟ for their PC. Whenever the rules say the GM would gain a Ⓟ (such as by activating a limit for a GMC), they gain a d6 bane die instead.  

Also, when the GM buys a hitch, instead of adding a die to the bane pool, they can instead choose to give the PC a complication with a die rating equal to the die that rolled the hitch.  

There are other ways to spend bane dice, in addition to substituting them for Ⓟ. The following special GM options are available, with each usually requiring a bane die of a particular size:  

To introduce a new GMC to a scene mid-conflict: Spend a bane die equal to the new GMC’s highest trait  

To interrupt the action order: Spend a die equal to or larger than the **Agility** die or **Scout** die (whichever is higher) of the character you’re interrupting, or spend any bane die if the interrupting GMC has an equal or greater **Agility** die or **Scout** die.  

To split the PC group: Spend a d10 or larger bane die to announce a sudden event that divides the party (such as a sudden cave-in, a crack opening in the earth, the activation of a hidden rune that creates a wall of fire, etc.)  

To immediately end the current scene in a dramatic way: Spend d12 d12 bane dice.  
  
### Setting Definition  
  
Whether you are gaming in your own original setting—which you might expand or refine over the course of the game—or using an existing fantasy backdrop such as Earthsea, Westeros, Middle Earth, the Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, or the Forgotten Realms, you can use the Setting Definition system presented here to get the whole group engaged with the world. Across three phases, all players collaborate to define elements of the setting. For an original world, this is an exercise in creative world-building; for an existing one, you’re recalling favorite details and emphasizing the ones you liked most. The latter can be just as usefulas the form, allowing your group to rediscover, reinterpret, and even simplify a world you have experience with, making it your own.  

This system is best deployed before character creation. Whenever an element is defined, write its name down on a 3x5 card (or a virtual equivalent).  
  
#### Phase One  
  
All players (including the GM) collaborate to define two setting elements: one Age, and one event.  
  
##### The First Age  
  
An Age is one of a handful of eras into which sages have divided the world’s history. Collaborate to define the first Age, an Age of myth and legend, and name it (“The Age of Myth”, “The Dawn Age”, “The First Age”, etc.), then define a supernatural event that was part of the creation of the world. This Age is not the current Age— that is a period you will define later.  
  
##### An Ill Omen  
  
This element is an event, a significant occurrence in your setting’s history. In this case, it is a recent event, something that has happened within the PCs’ lifetimes. Some force of darkness, domination, or destruction—perhaps ancient but previously dormant or working in hiding—has recently manifested or escalated, positioning itself (at least to those in the know) as a threat to the entire world. In fact, it is the greatest danger the world has faced in the current age, and it is a source of fear to many.  

However, at this stage you don’t need to fully define the darkness itself. Just describe how this event raised the stakes, and then give the looming threat a name (even a vague one) used by those who know of it. You should also decide as a group how well-known the threat is, whether the general public believes in it, and how long ago the event happened.  

This Ill Omen event is an event that inspires fear. For every other event you create during this phase and the next one, specify whether that event is generally a source of fear or a source of hope. A compelling setting history will include both kinds of events.  

These are the only two setting elements you determine collaboratively as a group. After this, further elements are each defined by individual players.  
  
#### Phase Two  
  
The GM picks another player to go first. Once a player takes a turn, they choose who goes next. Each player can only take one turn per round, and the GM must go last. After the GM takes a turn, they choose which player goes first the following round.  

On your turn, you do two things:  

First, you define a connection between two existing elements. (So the first player will narrate how the recent Ill Omen event connects to the first Age.) Record this connection the same way you record elements.  

Second, you define your own new element. The type of element you define is determined using the element types list below. You can either choose the type of element you wish to define or roll a d12 to determine it randomly.  
  
##### Element Types List  
  
1. An Age that is not the current Age  
2. A culture (human or otherwise)  
3. An event that created great hope or fear  
4. An important object  
5. An influential organization or faction  
6. A leader who changed history  
7. A legendary dynasty or lineage  
8. A motivating belief system or ideal  
9. A noteworthy creature  
10. A precious resource  
11. A significant settlement  
12. A unique landmark (or series of them)  
  
New elements can redefine previous ones, but not in ways that erase them. For example, one player might define a culture as an empire which conquers and unites the world, and another player might define a later event wherein that empire has since broken up into several smaller states. The rule is, an element remains part of the setting’s story, even if it is no longer intact in the current era. Keep taking turns until all of the following are true:  

▶ Every player (including the GM) has defined at least two elements  
▶ At least one new Age (besides the first Age or the current Age) has been defined  
▶ At least one new event (besides the Ill Omen) has been defined  
▶ At least two new cultures have been defined  
▶ Every player is comfortable having their character come from one or more of the defined cultures  
▶ At least ten total elements have been defined (including the first Age and the Ill Omen event)  
  
#### Phase Three  
  
During this phase, the GM defines two final elements, and then each player guides how the setting will be featured in your game.  
  
##### The Current Age  
  
Similarly to how the group defined the first Age, the GM defines the most recent Age, the one in which the game takes place. They name this Age, and define one major difference that sets it apart from previous ones. The GM then names and describes a new character, an analog GMC who is important to the PCs’ activities in this age. Once this is done, the GM selects a player to take the first turn defining the featured elements.  
  
##### Featured Elements  
  
On each player’s turn, they choose one element to be featured, then choose another player besides the GM to go next. Featured elements are those elements that the players are most excited to interact with during play, and they should be included—or at least alluded to—in the first session. Once every other player has chosen a featured element, the GM chooses one as well. Mark each featured element with an asterisk or other symbol.  

##### Completion  

After all three phases, you have a new (or reborn) fantasy world for your game. You are ready to create characters and then begin play.  
  
### Player Character Drives  
  
The drive traits described for GMCs also work well for player characters. Using them as a trait for PCs focuses the game more on who they are and what they are willing to sacrifice for, going beyond what they’re good at and how they handle danger. However, since the PCs are the center of the game, their drives need to be a bit deeper than the goals that make a monster interesting in a fight. When we give a player character drives, we define the major needs, desires, or social roles that motivate PCs to leave behind safety and comfort for the dangers and hardships of adventure.  

There are two ways to add drives to a *TorchLite* player character. The easiest way is to simply make them a pair of free extra signature assets for each character. However, for a game that seeks to emphasize these internal motivations even more, drives can also be their own separate trait set. Either way, when a drive fuels a character’s actions, the player can include it in their dice pool.  

Most drives are written as a phrase that states one of the character’s deepest motives, such as Drive: Avenge Our Family’s Downfall, Drive: Earn the Paladin’s Respect, Drive: Prove Mom was Wrong About Me, Drive: Never Let Anyone Manipulate Me Again, etc. A drive is an internal goal, more emotional than concrete, and they are always spurs to action, not mere opinions. "Good triumphs over evil" is a fine notion for a character to have, but it isn't a drive. To work for the game, it would need to be something like Drive: Align with the Forces of Good or Drive: Defeat Evil at All Costs. It must be something so large and personally meaningful that accomplishing it could require several sessions or even an entire campaign.  
  
#### Drives in Conflict  
  
When using drives, every character should have a pair that strongly contradict each other. Like the protagonists of popular dramatic stories throughout history—from Othello to Rhaenyra Targaryen—each PC is torn between two paths, and it seems impossible to follow both. For example, your character might have the following two drives: Drive: Show Everyone They Were Wrong About Me and Drive: Live Free from Others’ Expectations. Those drives present two needs that work against each other, but being torn between these two motivations will fuel great stories.  

In some ways, drives are potential identities for your character as well as goals. If your character were the main character of a TV series, the very last episode would show them finally choosing one of their two conflicting drives. Each of these different roads could lead to your character's destiny.  

With the help of your GM, make these two drives as clear, simple, and strongly opposed as you can. That makes it easier for you to evoke them during the game. Some players find it easier to make one drive a goal or identity that their character readily admits to themselves or others, while making the other an irresistible need that the character is less eager to dwell on. Others make the first drive more aspirational, whereas the second is grounded in the reality the character lives right now.  

If you want inspiration when choosing drives for a character, pop culture and literature offer endless examples you can emulate or modify for your own needs. Juliet in Romeo & Juliet has a dramatic conflict between her lifelong loyalty to her family and her sudden love for Romeo. Frodo in The Lord of the Rings is driven by the importance of his mission, but struggles against temptation. Luke Skywalker in Star Wars keeps having to choose between his fierce loyalty to the people he loves and his destiny as a Jedi. In Wakanda Forever, Shuri is torn between clinging to the past and becoming the champion her people need.  

However you determine these two paired drives, always resist the temptation to make one significantly more positive or attractive than the other; they work best when both are equally compelling, and each exerts a deep influence on your character's actions. Both drives begin play rated at d8.  
  
#### New and Temporary Drives  
  
In addition to the character’s two core drives, you can spend a Ⓟ at the start of a scene (or during a scene if everyone at the table agrees) to gain a temporary drive at d6. This temporary drive lasts until the end of the session rather than the end of the scene, so this works well for embodying shorter-term adventure goals, like Drive: Rescue the Captured Prince. In fact, the GM can even choose to let PCs gain a temporary drive for free if that drive is directly related to the central quest driving an adventure.  

Also, at the end of a session, a player can spend 5 XP to add a new permanent drive, rated at d6. This could be converting or rewriting a temporary drive, but it could also be adding an entirely new motivation to a character. Unlike other traits, however, drives cannot have their ratings improved with XP.  
  
#### How Drives Change  
  
At the end of a session, a player can choose one of their permanent drives and step it up, but when they do so, they must step another permanent drive down. Both drives keep their new rating until the next time the player chooses to adjust their drives in this way at the end of a session.  

Drives are intended to balance each other out, however, so having one drive that is too much higher than the others causes a serious drawback. While a PC has one drive rated at d12, but no other drives with the same rating, whenever they build a dice pool, the pool’s largest die steps down before they roll. This penalty lasts until the drive is stepped back down or until another drive is also somehow stepped up to d12.  

Another way a permanent drive can change is by being questioned during play. When this happens, the PC acts against the current drive, rewriting it to suit what they are doing. For example, they might go from Drive: Protect the Wizard at All Costs to Drive: Make the Wizard Pay for Betraying Me. Once a drive is questioned, the die for that drive is tripled the next time it is rolled. After that roll, the questioned drive remains rewritten, but until the end of the session, that drive’s die rating is stepped down, and another drive of the player’s choice is stepped up.  

At the end of the session, the player decides whether to keep the drive rewritten or return to what it was previously. They also decide whether to keep the stepped down and stepped up drives at their new ratings, or to restore the ratings to what they were.  

They might step up over time, but a PC’s two core, conflicting drives shouldn’t be permanently rewritten too often. Other drives should generally be more likely to change, while the core two continue to define ongoing story arcs, and if core drives are rewritten, it should be temporary unless there is a dramatic change in the character.  

If one or both of a PC’s core pair of drives do keep changing over the long-term, that player should have a discussion with the GM and maybe one or more of the other players, so that they can try to come up with a new core dramatic conflict— one that is interesting enough to be sustained for a while—and rewrite the two drives accordingly.  
  
### Troupe Characters  
  
One option to vastly extend your *TorchLite* game is to have each player portray multiple characters in a sprawling cast of allied heroes. Each player controls a collection of characters called a troupe. It is easiest to start with a single character in your troupe, and there is no limit to the number of characters you may add to the troupe.  
  
#### Playing with Troupe Characters  
  
Each session, you play one of the characters in your troupe. Your other characters do not appear in the story. Sometimes this requires a little creative justification (they’re, uh, visiting their mother), but usually doesn’t even need explanation.  

Any XP you earn while playing any of your characters is added to all of your characters at the end of the session. A good way to think of this is that XP is earned by players, not by characters.  

At the end of each session, decide which character you are going to play in the next session. This allows the GM to tailor the upcoming adventure to your character’s abilities and backstory.  
  
#### New Troupe Characters  
  
Add new characters to your troupe between sessions. These can be entirely new people, relations of established characters, or even characters who you’ve encountered or rescued in play. You can even create as playable characters the antagonists that you’ve faced off with before—just check with your GM that you’re not derailing any of their carefully-laid plans.  

Create a character as normal. You may then spend XP to add traits, step up existing traits, or add SFX. Just like all your other characters, their spent XP cannot exceed your earned XP.  

It costs nothing to add a character to your troupe.  
  
#### Retiring Characters  
  
Sometimes a hero’s story comes to a conclusion and the character is just… done. Perhaps they defeated their nemesis, saved their village, or found the lost cure for their brother’s debilitating disease. You could keep playing them, but it would feel forced and weird and honestly it just doesn’t sound like much fun. It’s time to retire them.  

When you retire a character, take a few moments at the end of their final session to collaborate with the table on what happens to the retired character. Figure out what their post-adventuring life looks like. Perhaps they accept a noble title and start managing a fiefdom. Perhaps they establish a hospital to care for travelers and the sick. Perhaps they execute a bloody takeover of the local thieves’ guild.  

A retired character is taken out of your troupe and given to the GM to use as an occasional GMC. This move requires a lot of trust, and GMs should be very careful to portray the character as content and generally helpful, but no longer able or willing to adventure. Seeing an old PC turned into a villain or even an antagonistic ally can be disappointing or even upsetting. They are supposed to be enjoying a well-earned retirement, after all!  

The other characters in your troupe (or even the other players’ characters) might form relationships with the retired character as a mentor. New characters added to the game may start play as the retired character’s apprentices, disciples, former retainers, or even children.  
  
### Dynamic Initiative  
  
In this variant rule, when a new action order begins, every player rolls a test to see who is able to act first. The player with the highest total becomes the first in the action order. However, everyone who rolled records their effect die, writing the total down as their "Interrupt" die and keeping it displayed for the rest of the scene. ("Interrupt d8", "Interrupt d10", etc.).  

At any time, when someone else is about to take a turn, you can expend your Interrupt to go before they do. However, if the player you are interrupting still has their own interrupt, they can expend it in response to take their turn normally, as long as their die rating equals or exceeds your own. Once a player expends their interrupt, it's gone. They don’t get a new one until a new action order begins.  

The GM doesn’t roll at the start of the action order unless they really want a particular GMC to act first. Instead, when the GM wants to interrupt a PC, they can give that PC a Ⓟ to immediately create a new interrupt die for themself and expend. This interrupt die is a d8, unless they give the PC extra Ⓟ to create a higher one: ⓅⓅ gets them a d10, and ⓅⓅⓅ gets a d12. Otherwise, the GM spends the interrupt die normally just as the other players would. The GM can have each GMC interrupt in this way once per scene.  

#### Example  

Jeremy, Lynn, and Miriam are starting a new round of action order against a mob and a boss, so they each roll a simple test.  

Jeremy scores a 14 total with d10 effect.  

Lynn scores a 13 total with d4 effect.  

Miriam scores a 9 total with d8 effect.  

The GM does not roll for either the mob or the boss.  

As Jeremy prepares to take his turn, Lynn declares he wants to interrupt. He only has a d4, but Jeremy doesn’t mind going second so he shrugs. Lynn takes his action.  

After Lynn’s turn, the GM is worried that their dastardly boss will get defeated before it even gets a good action, so she spends ⓅⓅ to interrupt Jeremy. The boss takes its turn, knocking a comely bystander GMC into the river.  

Miriam is eager to impress the drenched GMC, and spends her d8 interrupt die to go next and save her. This time, however, Jeremy spends his d10 interrupt to keep his place in the action order, so he can get credit for the save. Jeremy takes his turn.  

Before Miriam can go, the GM gives her a single Ⓟ for the mob’s interrupt. It would have cost two to beat Miriam’s d8, but she’s already spent it. The mob takes its turn.  

Finally, Miriam takes her turn.  
  
### Upsets  
  
This moderately complex mod provides a means to make your action sequences more dynamic, allowing the players and the GM to shift the scene’s foundations and consequences through play.  

An upset is an attempt to change the details of a scene in ways that cannot be expressed through assets, complications, and stress. You might roll an upset to unmoor a ship and escape boarders on the pier, to calm down an escalating bar brawl, to magnetize the floor and fix metal-shod characters in place, or to put out a towering fire raging all around the characters.  

Upsets can constrain and compel the actions of other players, but in typical *Cortex Lite* style: with player buy in and always allowing everyone an out if they’re willing to pay for it with drama.  
  
#### Rolling an Upset  
  
Any player may roll an upset on their turn.  

To roll an upset, describe what you’re trying to accomplish, then assemble and roll a dice pool as normal. Select the dice you are using for your total and effect and set them in front of you at the table. (If you’re playing online, make a sticky note or similar.) That’s it!  

Your total and effect die constitute a looming upset. Your total becomes the difficulty for any other player to roll against to counter your upset to the situation. Your effect die stands as the consequence that any challengers will have to face.  

While your looming upset is in play, the change to the situation that your character is trying to enact is in progress. You’re turning the capstan wheel to raise the ship’s anchor, you’re making your heartfelt entreaty for combatants to stand down, you’re operating the magnet-floor console, you’re slinging water buckets all over the flaming scene. What you want hasn’t happened yet, but it’s about to.  

Your turn ends here.  
  
#### Your Turn Under a Looming Upset  
  
When you take your turn and there’s a looming upset in play, what you choose to do with your turn is also a decision about the looming upset in play. You might spend your turn opposing the looming upset. Or you might let it happen—because you’re more focused on doing something else, or you’re intimidated by that high difficulty number, or maybe you want the looming upset to happen.  
  
#### Giving In to an Upset  
  
While a looming upset is in play, players may give in to the upset, accepting constraints or compulsions on their actions. Giving in earns you a plot point.  

Importantly, choosing to do something else on your turn when that doesn’t constrain or compel your actions is not giving in. If someone is trying to de-escalate a rowdy bar and you’re in the corner quietly deciphering en encoded scroll, you’re not giving in. Giving in always involves accepting constraints or compulsions on your actions, which is why it earns you a plot point. Otherwise, you’re just taking your turn.  

You may give in to any looming upset at the start of your turn. Once you have given in, you may not roll to contest the upset.  

Not every character in a scene is necessarily eligible to give in. If the upset was to magnetize the floor and to fix in place everyone wearing metal boots, characters who aren’t wearing metal boots can’t give in. That upset isn’t aimed at them, and it makes no sense for them to buy into those constraints.  

If you give in, you may immediately spend the plot point you earn on whatever you are doing with your turn.  

The constraint or compulsion that you accept as a part of your give are applicable for the rest of the scene. These circumstances may continue or develop in later scenes: if you give in to being magnetized to the floor this scene, the Game Moderator might open the next scene with you still stuck. Depending on how things play out, the next scene might even start with you bound and gagged.  

Once you give in, you are not without options. You may start a new upset to undermine the constraints or compulsions you gave in to.  
  
#### Contesting an Upset  
  
While a looming upset is in play, players may use their turn to contest the upset, trying to stop the in-progress change from happening. You may only contest an upset if your character may plausibly take action to stop the impending change.  

You may try to stop the situation from changing entirely, or you may try to change the situation in a new direction (which is more fun, honestly).  

To contest an upset, describe what you’re doing, assemble a die pool, and roll it.  

If your total beats the looming upset’s difficulty, the looming upset is removed from play. Your total and effect become a new looming upset.  

While your looming upset is in play, you are engaged in stopping the prior upset from happening: struggling with the anchor capstan, shouting down the heartfelt entreaty, counterspelling the magnet-floor enchantment to prevent its activation, knocking over people in the fire bucket brigade.  

Your new looming upset works like any other looming upset. Other players may earn a plot point by giving in and accepting your upset’s constraints or compulsions. The player whose upset you beat may give in to accept that their change to the situation will not happen in the current scene.  

Players who gave in to the removed upset follow the fiction. If it makes sense in the scene, they continue to be constrained or compelled. If the new looming upset wins out, the players may choose how its resolution impacts them.  

If you contest an upset and fail to beat the difficulty, you take a complication equal to the looming effect die. If your effect die is larger than the looming effect die, step down the effect die before taking the complication. The looming upset’s player decides the nature of the complication, but may take suggestions.  

You may contest multiple upsets at the same time, if this makes sense in the scene. Describe how you make that happen, and be sure to say which upsets you are contesting. You must beat the highest difficulty and assign a different effect die to each upset. If you succeed, all the upsets are removed from play, replaced with your total and the smallest effect die you assigned. If you fail, you suffer a complication from each looming upset.  
  
#### Upsetting the Situation  
  
If you start your turn and your upset is still looming, its resolution is imminent. Any player who hasn’t yet taken a turn under your looming upset may take their turn before yours to contest your upset or give in.  

If your looming upset still stands, whatever you’re trying to do comes to pass at the top of your turn.  

A resolved looming upset changes the circumstances in the scene—the ship comes unmoored and cuts off your pursuers, the combatants stand down, the floors are magnetized, everybody and everything in the scene is now wet (but not on fire). An upset never inflicts complications on characters, but it can remove characters from the scene.  

Any players who contested the upset, failed, and scored a complication for their trouble may describe where they end up in the aftermath. They might be on the pier or on the unmoored ship, they might be the only combatant still fighting, they might lift their boots off the grating just in time, they might be the only dry person in the room.  

The resolution of a looming upset does not take up your turn. You get to take some other action as your turn, or start another upset.  
  
#### Upsetting Interactions  
  
Upsets are a powerful and flexible tool, and they work with most other *TorchLite* rules.  

Spend plot points to add additional dice to your total as contests boost the difficulty ever higher.  

Additional effect dice can create assets, inflict complications, or recover complications.  

Heroic successes step up an upset’s effect die.  

Upsets can be used to disable scene distinctions like Towering Inferno.  
  
### Modifying *TorchLite*  
  
*TorchLite* is designed to be modified, even beyond the extra options provided in this section. Its components are loosely integrated and can be removed, replaced, and extended with relative ease. The *Cortex Prime Game Handbook* provides a wealth of options.  

Don’t like attributes? Really want values to be involved? Have you never quite gotten over FASERIP? Just swap out trait sets or add new ones to your sheets. If you’re really ambitious you can build out whole power sets for esoteric training, magical items, or strange heritages. The only wrinkle here is making sure that SFX do not refer to traits that have been swapped out.When an SFX references such a trait, just replace it with an appropriate trait in the new set.  

Milestones and XP advancement can be replaced with any other advancement mechanic.  

Want to add a sense of momentum to your adventures? Want a little more back-and-forth in your duels or debates? Additional mods from the Handbook can be added directly to *TorchLite*. Rules like Hero Dice, and Contests require no tweaking to make fit. SFX can be rewritten to take added mechanics into account, but it’s not a prerequisite.  

With enough mods, you might ask if you’re really playing *TorchLite* any longer, but it’s not a terribly important question. What matters is if you and your friends are having fun.  

There are even other games out there that you can… uh… borrow? Import? Or heck, just plain steal some or all of their mechanics for your own game.  
  
#### The Arcanist’s Toolkit  
  
*TorchLite* has a tremendously robust magic system. The SFX available within the various professions of this book will get you far – but where do you turn if you want to go further? The *Arcanist’s Toolkit* offers seven different magic systems, each of which evokes a different tone or play style.  

There’s the studious creativity of spells alongside the grim horror of dolormancy, the magic of pain.  

The grounding mod allows you to balance risk and reward, and could be perfect for a chaos mage.  

A hexknight would delight at the possibilities of augmentation, while any character of any kind can get involved with the fun of rituals.  

You can even create brand new peoples or professions with exclusive access to some of these mods – a Dolormancer profession, perhaps, or an Elementalist using the spheres mod.  

The *Arcanist’s Toolkit* isn’t intended to be used all at the same time – all seven mods in one game would be absolute chaos! But by using the existing framework provided to you by *TorchLite*, you can personalize evocative systems of magic that your players will love.  

Find The *Arcanist’s Toolkit* on [itch.io](https://rileyrouth.itch.io/the-arcanists-toolkit)   
  
#### Keystone Fantasy’s Bestiary and Emporium  
  
These supplements provide plug-and-play rules for fantastic animals and fantastic props. While they were developed for the larger Keystone Fantasy Roleplaying system (also compatible with *Cortex Lite* and *Cortex Prime*), they can be used with *TorchLite* with little to no modification.  

The *Bestiary of the Speaking Lands* details a simple method of combining a library of animalistic distinctions and SFX to create animals both mundane and mythical. These beasts can be dropped directly into *TorchLite* adventure prep with no modification. The library of distinctions and SFX can also be modified to use with player characters, especially the feral ones.  

The *Emporium of the Speaking Lands* offers elaborate rules support for “cool stuff” that one might find in epic fantasy adventures. The rules cover everything from specialty weaponry to magical devices to singing swords. Most of this is performed by an eminently stealable library of more than 100 SFX, but the book also includes extended rules for crafts, loot, and wealth.  

Visit [Keystone](https://keystone.miriamrobern.com) for more.  
  
#### Manual of Monsters, Minions & Mountebanks  
  
This compendium was designed directly for use with *TorchLite*. It takes the over 300 monsters from Dungeons & Dragons 5e SRD and presents them as driven challenges, complete with signature assets and SFX.  

While the templates can be used right off the page, they can also be whittled down, substituted, or added to as befits your needs. They serve as direct conversion examples for taking 5e content and liting it up with your torch.  

Available on [itch.io](https://ljrstudiosouth.itch.io/monsters)   
  
#### Drintera  
  
This ambitious worldbuilding project has brought together a diverse team of writers, artists, and editors. Together they are creating a unique fantasy world built on the design principles of multicultural roots, heroic mythology, and deep lore. Drintera is a canvas for creativity for young and mature players alike.  

As a system-agnostic setting, Drintera has no rules to weave into *TorchLite*. Instead it offers a fresh and vibrant world full of exciting possibilities. Your game can visit the stolid feudal peoples of Neire,the sophisticated cultures to Mor Thia, and indulge in exciting swashbuckling through the Sundered Isles, or go even further afield.

### Transferring Characters to Another Game  
  
Wanting to see what else Cortex has to offer but not wanting to build out the pieces yourself? Looking for other examples to draw inspiration from? Explore more in two other published Cortex fantasy settings, Tales of Xadia and Keystone Fantasy.  
  
#### Converting your Characters  
  
It is a simple process to convert *TorchLite* characters to other games that are also compatible with Cortex Prime. You will almost always keep your distinctions, specialties, and signature assets intact and unchanged.  

Other trait sets are exercises in mapping. Connect each remaining *TorchLite* trait to another in the corresponding game. Your **Brawn** d8 might become Strength d8, for instance. If the new game uses a trait that doesn’t have a similar *TorchLite* trait, start it at d6. If the new game doesn’t have any trait that maps to a *TorchLite* trait, the *TorchLite* trait can become a specialty or signature asset, or can be worked into the name of an existing distinction.  

SFX can sometimes be transferred with no changes, while some may require editing. Traits referenced within SFX can be remapped in the same way as trait sets: “step up **Brawn**” just becomes “step up **Strength**.” If no amount of remapping works, you can simply replace the SFX with a more appropriate one from the new game.  

...or Start Fresh!  

If this process sounds cumbersome, you can always start fresh. You can recreate the same character using the new game’s character creation rules, or you can step into the new world with a new character.  
  
#### Tales of Xadia  
  
Set in the world of Netflix’s *The Dragon Prince*, *Tales of Xadia* (ToX) offers an excellent take on modern fantasy gaming. The game focuses on plucky protagonists confronting large-scale themes through small-scale situations. And don’t let the source material being a kid’s show fool you: it’s perfectly capable of supporting serious, dramatic, and adult play, as well.  

ToX leaves behind roles in place of values with statements. This shifts the game’s focus from what the characters are doing to why they are doing it. Characters will question their values, pushing themselves to find what they truly stand for. Woven in with values are goals which earn you growth dice replacing milestones and XP.  

For the GM, ToX introduces catalysts. These provocative GMCs wedge themselves into the PCs world, promising to become hardened allies or treacherous villains. PCs can influence catalyst development through interaction and Cortex’s other central resolution method - contests. Whole party conflict resolution remains familiar utilizing challenges as a consolidation of crises, mobs, and bosses rolled into one.  

These elements come together to foster a more roleplay forward table experience than *TorchLite*’s more adventure centric design.  

Visit [Tales of Xadia](https://www.talesofxadia.com/) for more.  
  
#### Keystone Fantasy  
  
Colorful, rangy fantasy epics that inexorably descend into labyrinthine character and setting backstory is the goal of Keystone Fantasy Roleplaying. Depending on table preferences, Keystone can produce play ranging from the best long-running TTRPG streamer sagas to the kind of beloved, fantasy schlock that Hollywood churned out in the 80s.  

Keystone uses half as many attributes than *TorchLite*, but you can combine pairs of *TorchLite* attributes to map them to Keystone. **Agility** and **Brawn** make Physical; **Alertness** and **Brains** make Mental. Use the higher of each pair for the new attribute. Or ditch attributes entirely and create Values.  

Instead of *TorchLite*’s five roles, Keystone uses 19 skills. Map each role to two skills. *TorchLite* specialties may map directly to skills or become new signature assets.  

Visit [Keystone](https://keystone.miriamrobern.com) for more.  
  
### Random Characters  
  
You can quickly generate one or more character elements, or even the entire character, by using the directions in this section. The GM can use this for GMCs, either during prep or to roll up quick incidental characters. Even players can use this, combined with Quick Character Creation, to create randomized characters: just do the steps and name the resulting adventurer, ready for play.  
  
#### People  
  
First roll a d12 and find the row for the resulting number. Then roll a d8 and find the column for that result. Your random people result is where the row meets the column.
